# ChicagoCityCouncilProceedings

This project is developed to convert the PDF City Council of Chicago Journals of Proceedings to markdown/text files that can be used by researchers and citizens for computational analysis of the machinations of City Hall. 

Contributing to this project can include 
- Downloading and organizing the proceedings PDFs
- Converting assembled PDFs to markdown or text files

To contribute to this repository, you must have [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) set up on your machine. The proceeding PDFs are quite large, even when compresed.  

Right now, I am currently working on:
