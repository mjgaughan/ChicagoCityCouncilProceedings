# ChicagoCityCouncilProceedings

This project is developed to convert the publicly available PDFs of City Council of Chicago Journals of Proceedings to markdown/text files that can be more easily used for computational analysis of meeting minutes. The proceeding PDFs are quite large, even when compresed. Proceedings are accessed through their [online index](https://www.chicityclerk.com/legislation-records/journals-and-reports/journals-proceedings).   

For a currently checklist of what proceedings I am currently working on, please see TODO.md.
