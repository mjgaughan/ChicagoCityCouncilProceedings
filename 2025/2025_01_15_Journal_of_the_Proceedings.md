[R2025-0014859]

The Honorable Brandon Johnson, Mayor, presented the following communication:

OFFICE OF THE MAYOR
CITY OF CHICAGO

January 15, 2025.

To the Honorable, The City Council of the City of Chicago:

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- I transmit herewith, together with Aldermen Silverstein, Harris, Hadden, Vasquez, Rodriguez, La Spata, Manaa-Hoppenworth, Nugent, Martin, Dowell, Mitts, Cruz, Lee, Moore, Clay, Ramirez-Rosa, Reilly, Rodriguez-Sanchez, Lawson, Conway, O'Shea, Hopkins, Villegas, Robinson, Sigcho-Lopez, Chico, Coleman, Taliaferro and City Clerk Valencia, a resolution honoring International Holocaust Day.

Your favorable consideration of this resolution will be appreciated.

Very truly yours,

(Signed) BRANDON JOHNSON,
Mayor.

Alderperson Harris moved to Suspend the Rules Temporarily to permit immediate consideration of and action upon the said proposed resolution. The motion Prevailed.

The following is said proposed resolution:

WHEREAS, Tens of thousands of Jewish households call Chicago, the surrounding suburbs, and the 50th Ward "home", and their heritage is part of Chicago's rich history; and

WHEREAS, The Jewish American experience has been affected dramatically by the Holocaust with many Jewish residents of Chicagoland being descendants of a Holocaust survivor, victim or refugee; and

WHEREAS, January 27 is designated by the United Nations as International Holocaust Remembrance Day and serves as a day for people across the world to remember the
six million Jews murdered during the Holocaust, alongside the millions of others persecuted and killed by Nazis, their collaborators and allies; and

WHEREAS, This year marks 80 years since the liberation of Auschwitz, the largest Nazi killing center and concentration camp complex, where approximately one million Jews perished along with 70 thousand Poles, 21 thousand Roma and Sinti, 15 thousand Soviet POWs and 12 thousand prisoners of other ethnic backgrounds; and

WHEREAS, Across the United States, and here in Chicago, we have seen a dramatic increase in hate crimes and violence against Jewish people and we must be more vigilant than ever against attacks on the dignity and welfare of ethnic and religious groups; and

WHEREAS, On International Holocaust Remembrance Day, the United Nations and the entire world honors the legacy of Holocaust victims and survivors through their remarkable stories and history, and we increase efforts to counter Holocaust denial, distortion, and revisionism; and

WHEREAS, Extremists across the world are increasingly attempting to deny the historical reality and the extent of the annihilation of the Jews by the Nazis and their accomplices, including intentional efforts to diminish the impact of the Holocaust and minimize the number of victims; and

WHEREAS, Holocaust denial is an expression of antisemitism and requires an international response aimed at combating racism and hate; now, therefore,

Be It Resolved, That we, the Mayor and members of the City Council of the City of Chicago, assembled this 15th day of January 2025, do hereby recognize January 27, 2025 as International Holocaust Remembrance Day, and pledge -- through our continued commitment to the people of Chicago -- to honor the memory of those who died in the Holocaust, as well as those who survived to share their experiences and wisdom with the world; and

Be It Further Resolved, That a suitable copy of this resolution be presented to the Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center and 3G Chicago in recognition of all their work to educate people about the Holocaust and honor the legacy of Holocaust victims and survivors.

On motion of Alderperson Mitchell, seconded by Alderpersons Silverstein, Lawson, Knudsen, Vasquez, Napolitano, Lee, Curtis and Burnett, the foregoing resolution was Adopted by yeas and nays as follows:

Yeas -- Alderpersons La Spata, Hopkins, Dowell, Robinson, Yancy, Hall, Mitchell, Harris, Beale, Chico, Lee, Ramirez, Quinn, Gutierrez, Lopez, Coleman, Moore, Curtis, O'Shea, Taylor, Mosley, Rodriguez, Tabares, Scott, Sigcho-Lopez, Fuentes, Burnett, Ervin, Taliaferro, Cruz, Cardona, Waguespack, Rodriguez-Sanchez, Conway, Ramirez-Rosa, Villegas, Mitts, Sposato, Nugent, Vasquez, Napolitano, Reilly, Knudsen, Lawson, Gardiner, Clay, Martin, Manaa-Hoppenworth, Hadden, Silverstein -- 50.

Nays -- None.

Alderperson Mitchell moved to reconsider the foregoing vote. The motion was lost.
At this point in the proceedings, the Honorable Brandon Johnson, Mayor, joined the members of the City Council in recognizing International Holocaust Remembrance Day and reaffirming our commitment to stand against hate in the City of Chicago. January 27, 2025 marks the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the German Nazi concentration and extermination camp Auschwitz and where it is estimated that one million Jewish people perished, along with tens of thousands of Polish and Romanian people, prisoners of war, and prisoners of other ethnic backgrounds, the Mayor observed, and the world learned the full extent of the horrors of the Holocaust. Proclaiming the importance of preserving and sharing their stories of tragedy and heartbreak as well as stories of heroism and love shining through the darkest of times, International Holocaust Remembrance Day enables us to honor those victims and survivors and remember their remarkable histories, the Mayor stated. These stories not only keep the memory of the millions of people who perished in the Holocaust alive, the Mayor continued, but also remind us to remain vigilant and unwavering in the fight against hatred. “Let us mark this day -- not just with words -- but with continued actions to make the City of Chicago a more unified, vibrant, and equitable place for all to live and thrive”, the Mayor declared. Denouncing the many extremist voices around the world and in our nation who continue to sow division and hatred and attempt to deny the realities of the Holocaust, Mayor Johnson called upon all Chicagoans to fight against hatred to ensure that our city continues to always be a beacon of progress, acceptance, and love. “We will never deny or forget the Holocaust”, the Mayor asserted, and vowed to “commemorate it with actions that honor the victims and survivors, the Jewish community, and the people of Chicago”. Mayor Johnson then expressed his privilege in presenting a copy of the memorial resolution to the Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center along with 3g Chicago in recognition of their work to educate people about the Holocaust and honor the legacy of its victims and survivors.

Rules Suspended -- TRIBUTE TO LATE WILLIAM “BILL” BEAVERS.

[R2025-0014856]

The Honorable Brandon Johnson, Mayor, presented the following communication:

OFFICE OF THE MAYOR
CITY OF CHICAGO

January 15, 2025.

To the Honorable, The City Council of the City of Chicago:

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- I transmit herewith, together with Aldermen Mitchell, Coleman, Harris, Hadden, Vasquez, Rodriguez, La Spata, Manaa-Hoppenworth, Martin, Dowell, Mitts, Cruz, Lee, Moore, Clay, Ramirez-Rosa, Rodriguez-Sanchez, Lawson, Silverstein, Conway, O’Shea, Villegas, Robinson, Sigcho-Lopez, Chico and Taliaferro, a memorial resolution honoring the life of William “Bill” Beavers.
Your favorable consideration of this resolution will be appreciated.

Very truly yours,

(Signed) BRANDON JOHNSON,
Mayor.

Alderperson Harris moved to *Suspend the Rules Temporarily* to permit immediate consideration of and action upon the said proposed resolution. The motion *Prevailed*.

The following is said proposed resolution:

WHEREAS, In recognition of a life of five decades of dedicated public service and leadership, the Mayor and members of this Chamber wish to acknowledge the legacy of William “Bill” Beavers, Chicago City Council Alderperson of the 7th Ward from 1983 until his 2006 election as Cook County Commissioner of the Fourth District, serving through 2013; and

WHEREAS, Born in 1935 in Chicago and growing up in the Kenwood and Oakland neighborhoods, Beavers was raised in a working-class family, where he learned the value of hard work and accountability from his loving mother, a renowned cook, and his father, a steel mill worker, attending Chicago Public Schools before attending Harold Washington College; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Beavers served as a Chicago police officer for 21 years before transitioning into politics, and was a dominant force in Chicago politics, using his larger-than-life personality, deep community engagement and his passion for economic and political empowerment of the Black community to proudly represent his beloved South Side; and

WHEREAS, Alderperson Beavers served as the chair of the Committee on Police and Fire and later as the chair of the Committee on the Budget and Government Operations and his great accomplishments include creating opportunities for Black entrepreneurs to engage with the City on every level and contributing towards gaining greater representations of Black judges on benches in Cook County; and

WHEREAS, After successfully running for Cook County Commissioner of the Fourth District in 2006, Commissioner Beavers continued to his unapologetic advocacy for the election and influence of Black voices in government and the business community, bringing businesses and political power to his constituents on the South Side and South Suburbs and focusing his agenda on Black economic empowerment and engagement with government; and

WHEREAS, No memorial of Alderperson Beavers would be complete without recognition of his reputation for no-nonsense and colorful style, always being dressed to the nines, his characteristic deep-voiced chuckle and genuine, direct talk famously described by those close to him as a man who “meant what he said and said what he meant”; and
WHEREAS, Commissioner Beavers' proudest accomplishments left deeply lasting change throughout Cook County, with his economic opportunity agenda leading directly opening high-profile City contracting opportunities at O'Hare and Midway Airports to Black-owned businesses, a legacy that many prominent Black business owners in the City credit directly to his efforts; and

WHEREAS, Throughout working with a statewide coalition of prominent Black lawmakers, Mr. Beavers was instrumental in creating judicial sub-circuits on the South Side, West Side, and South Suburbs -- where Black judges were previously underrepresented -- which allowed for the election of a number of African American judges, past and present; and

WHEREAS, Alderperson Beavers will go down in history as one of the most progressive Black elected officials in Cook County, with a lasting legacy to be felt for years to come, and serves as a reminder to stand up for the people's beliefs and to remember that government belongs to the people; now, therefore,

Be It Resolved, That we, the Mayor and the members of the City Council of the City of Chicago, assembled this 15th day of January 2025, do hereby commemorate the decades of dedicated public service of Alderperson and Commissioner William “Bill” Beavers; acknowledge his life-changing impact on the lives touched through his work; and express our heartfelt condolences and gratitude to his family and loved ones for sharing his life with the residents of Chicago; and

Be It Further Resolved, That a suitable copy of this resolution be presented to the family of William “Bill” Beavers as a sign of our appreciation and esteem for his contributions, and as an expression of our deepest sympathy.

On motion of Alderperson Mitchell, seconded by Alderpersons Ervin, Burnett, Harris, Moore, Robinson, Beale and Coleman, the foregoing resolution was Adopted by a rising vote.

At this point in the proceedings, the Honorable Brandon Johnson, Mayor, joined the members of the City Council in commemorating the life and legacy of the late William Beavers. A longstanding and dedicated public servant, William Beavers began his life of service as a Chicago Police Officer, serving and protecting for 21 years, the Mayor observed, and in 1983, he continued his service to the city when he was elected alderman of the 7th Ward on the Southeast Side. As alderman, William Beavers continually worked to propel Black-owned businesses and advocate for Black business owners, the Mayor stated, and his steadfast efforts helped to improve opportunities for Black entrepreneurs to engage in city business and contracts. Mr. Beavers continued to advocate for Black economic empowerment, opportunity and representation when he was elected to the Cook County Board of Commissioners in 2006, the Mayor asserted, and was instrumental in ensuring that Black voices were heard and represented in government and the business community. Expressing gratitude to Mr. Beavers for his legacy of leadership, public service and advocacy, Mayor Johnson proclaimed that "while we mourn this incredible loss, let us take comfort in his enduring legacy and indelible contributions that will stay with us for generations to come".
Rules Suspended -- TRIBUTE TO LATE JOSE “CHA CHA” JIMÉNEZ.

The Honorable Brandon Johnson, Mayor, presented the following communication:

OFFICE OF THE MAYOR
CITY OF CHICAGO

January 15, 2025.

To the Honorable, The City Council of the City of Chicago:

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- I transmit herewith, together with Aldermen Fuentes, Hadden, Vasquez, Rodríguez, La Spata, Manaa-Hoppenworth, Martin, Mitts, Cruz, Lee, Moore, Clay, Ramirez-Rosa, Rodríguez-Sánchez, Lawson, Conway, O’Shea, Villegas, Robinson, Sigcho-Lopez and Taliaferro, a resolution memorializing the life of José (Cha-Cha) Jiménez.

Your favorable consideration of this resolution will be appreciated.

Very truly yours,

(Signed) BRANDON JOHNSON,
Mayor.

Alderperson Harris moved to Suspend the Rules Temporarily to permit immediate consideration of and action upon the said proposed resolution. The motion Prevailed.

The following is said proposed resolution:

WHEREAS, José “Cha Cha” Jiménez, a founder of the Young Lords Organization, was a visionary leader, organizer and activist whose lifelong dedication to justice, equality and the empowerment of Puerto Ricans and marginalized communities has left an indelible mark on Chicago and beyond; and

WHEREAS, Born on August 8, 1948 in Caguas, Puerto Rico, to Puerto Rican parents, José “Cha Cha” Jiménez grew up in the Lincoln Park neighborhood, where he witnessed firsthand the systemic injustices of poverty, displacement and racial inequality; and

WHEREAS, In 1968, José “Cha Cha” Jiménez transformed the Young Lords Organization from a street gang into a powerful political and social movement advocating for the rights of Puerto Rican and other Latino communities, promoting grassroots organizing, self-determination and community empowerment; and

WHEREAS, Under Jiménez’s leadership, the Young Lords played a pivotal role in raising awareness about issues such as gentrification, police brutality, housing inequities,
educational disparities and healthcare access while also forming coalitions with other movements to fight for racial and economic justice; and

WHEREAS, José “Cha Cha” Jiménez worked tirelessly to establish programs like free breakfast initiatives, community health clinics and cultural centers, demonstrating his commitment to building stronger, more resilient communities rooted in mutual aid and solidarity; and

WHEREAS, The Young Lords’ activism and Jiménez’s leadership have inspired generations of activists and organizers across Cook County and the nation, serving as a powerful reminder of the strength of collective action in the fight for justice; and

WHEREAS, José “Cha Cha” Jiménez continued his advocacy throughout his life, reflecting a steadfast dedication to his principles and an enduring commitment to uplifting the voices of the oppressed; and

WHEREAS, The City Council of the City of Chicago recognizes the profound contributions of José “Cha Cha” Jiménez to the Puerto Rican community, Chicago and the broader struggle for social justice; now, therefore,

Be It Resolved, That we, the Mayor and the members of the City Council of the City of Chicago, assembled this 15th day of January 2025, do hereby honor and celebrate the life and legacy of José “Cha Cha” Jiménez and express our deepest gratitude for his tireless advocacy, leadership, and unwavering pursuit of equality and justice for all; and

Be It Further Resolved, That a suitable copy of this resolution be presented to the family of José “Cha Cha” Jiménez as a symbol of our respect, admiration and heartfelt condolences.

On motion of Alderperson Fuentes, seconded by Alderpersons Villegas, Cardona, Ramirez-Rosa, Rodriguez and Sigcho-Lopez, the foregoing resolution was Adopted by a rising vote.

At this point in the proceedings, the Honorable Brandon Johnson, Mayor, joined the members of the City Council in commemorating the life and legacy of the late José “Cha-Cha” Jiménez. Acknowledging the members of the Jimenez family seated in the commissioners gallery, Mayor Johnson stated, "I think it's actually quite appropriate that this resolution is raised at a moment in time where our challenges are immense . . . but I'm so grateful that we have the life and the legacy of 'Cha Cha', who is an example to what is possible even through dark times and when fear abounds". Lauding José “Cha-Cha” Jimenez for his courage, conviction and unwavering pursuit for equality and justice, Mayor Johnson celebrated the leadership and incredible example he set as an advocate for empowering and uplifting the voice of marginalized communities. “His voice and his power united the city against these challenges and has inspired generations that exist today”, the Mayor stated, and his call to activism has left a positive and lasting impact on our city. José “Cha-Cha” Jimenez’s vision and determination helped transform the Young Lords street gang into a powerful political and social grassroots movement that advocated for the rights of Chicago’s Puerto Rican community and Latinx neighborhoods, the Mayor stated, and helped bring awareness to the issues that were affecting their community, including police brutality, gentrification, and racial and systemic inequities. The Young Lords Organization also served
their community by filling a critical gap to ensure their neighbors and fellow Latinx residents could thrive in our city, the Mayor asserted, and under José "Cha-Cha" Jiménez's stewardship, the Young Lords Organization established free breakfast initiatives, community health clinics, and cultural centers and their impact extended beyond the generation that raised them and beyond the borders of the City of Chicago. As an aldermanic candidate, José "Cha-Cha" Jiménez supported Harold Washington's run for mayor, Mayor Johnson observed, and demonstrated the power of a progressive, dynamic and broad coalition crossing racial, economic and generational boundaries and which helped create a movement that continues today. His lifelong work to uplift and serve Chicago's Puerto Rican and Latinx communities has left a positive, lasting impact on our city, the Mayor declared, and he leaves behind a more resilient and united Chicago. Mayor Johnson then expressed his personal condolences to the Jimenez family and called upon all Chicagoans to commit to carrying on the work of José "Cha-Cha" Jiménez to build a city where everyone is empowered and protected.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Illinois General Assembly passed the Tax Increment Allocation Redevelopment Act, 65 ILCS 5/11-74.4-1 et.seq., as amended (the "Act") to provide municipalities with the mechanism to address blighted conditions, encourage private investment and to restore and enhance the tax base through development and redevelopment of project areas. To induce redevelopment pursuant to the Act, the City of Chicago City Council adopted three ordinances on October 5, 2016 approving the Diversey/Chicago River Tax Increment Financing Redevelopment Area Project and Plan (the "Original Plan" or the "Plan"); designating the Diversey/Chicago River Redevelopment Project Area (the "Original Project Area"); and adopting tax increment financing for the Original Project Area (the "Diversey/Chicago River TIF").

The Original Plan is being amended to expand the boundaries of the Original Project Area to include a 12.8-acre site immediately south of the Original Project Area. This area includes 11 of the 33 buildings in the Lathrop Homes public housing complex and is generally bounded by Damen Avenue on the east, the Chicago River on the south and west, and on the north by an irregular line that lies between 214 feet and 354 feet south of Diversey Parkway and runs along the south line of the Lathrop Homes buildings commonly numbered as 13, 6, and 2 ("Expansion Area"). The area is described in more detail in the supplemental report entitled, Diversey/Chicago River Expansion Area Tax Increment Financing Eligibility Report ("Expansion Area Eligibility Report"). The Expansion Area and the Original Project Area are referred to as the "Amended Project Area." As a whole, the Amended Project Area is generally bounded on the north by Wellington Avenue, on the east by Clybourn and Damen avenues, and on the south and west by the Chicago River and encompasses 33.82 acres.

The changes encapsulated in this document, referred to as Diversey/Chicago River Tax Increment Financing Redevelopment Project and Plan Amendment No. 1, serve as a supplement to the Original Plan. In this document and in remaining portions of the Original Plan, the term "Plan," "Amended Plan" or "Amendment No. 1" may be used interchangeably and refer to the changes to date as reflected in this Amendment No. 1 document.

On and after November 1, 1999, no existing redevelopment plan may be amended if the redevelopment plan causes the displacement of residents from 10 or more inhabited residential units unless the municipality undertakes a housing impact study or certifies that such displacement will not result from the plan. The City hereby certifies that there will not be displacement of 10 or more inhabited units within the redevelopment project area. As such, a housing impact study is not required as part of Amendment No. 1.

The Plan summarizes the analyses and findings of the consultant's work, which, unless otherwise noted, is the responsibility of Johnson Research Group, Inc. (the "Consultant"). The City is entitled to rely on the findings and conclusions of this Plan in designating the Expansion Area as a redevelopment project area under the Act. The Consultant has prepared this Amendment No. 1 and the related supplemental Expansion Area Eligibility Report with the understanding that the City would rely: 1) on the findings and conclusions of Amendment No. 1 and the related Expansion Area Eligibility Report in proceeding with the expansion of the Original Project Area and the adoption and implementation of Amendment No. 1, and 2) on the fact that the Consultant has obtained the necessary information so that Amendment No. 1 and the related Expansion Area Eligibility Report complies with the Act.
MODIFICATIONS TO THE DIVERSEY/CHICAGO RIVER TIF AMENDMENT NO. 1

The changes to the Diversey/Chicago River Tax Increment Financing Redevelopment Area Project and Plan are presented section by section and follow the format of the Original Plan. This Amendment No. 1 document serves as a supplement to the sections of the Original Plan that remain unchanged.

C. Redevelopment Improvements and Activities – no changes

D. Redevelopment Project Costs – Part 2 of this subsection is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

2. Estimated Redevelopment Project Costs

A range of redevelopment activities and improvements will be required to implement this Redevelopment Plan. The activities and improvements and their estimated costs are set forth below in Table 1. Estimated Redevelopment Project Costs. All estimates are based on 2024 dollars. Funds may be moved from one line item to another or to an eligible cost category described in this Redevelopment Plan at the City’s discretion.

Redevelopment Project Costs described in this Redevelopment Plan are intended to provide an upper estimate of expenditures. Within this upper estimate, adjustments may be made in line items without amending this Redevelopment Plan.

Table 1. Estimated Redevelopment Project Costs

| Eligible Redevelopment Project Costs                                                                 | Estimated Cost |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Analysis, Administration, Studies, Surveys, Legal and Marketing (65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-74.4-3(q)(1)) | 100,000        |
| Site Preparation, Demolition and Environmental Remediation (65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-74.4-3(q)(2))     | 400,000        |
| Affordable Housing Construction and Rehabilitation Costs (65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-74.3-3(q)(3))      | 45,500,000     |
| Public Works & Improvements, including streets and utilities, parks and open space, and other public facilities (65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-74.3-3(q)(4)) | 14,000,000     |
| TOTAL REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT COSTS                                                                   | $60,000,000    |

The total Redevelopment Project Costs represent an upper limit on expenditures that are to be funded using TIF revenues and exclude any additional financing costs, including any interest expense, capitalized interest and costs associated with optional redemptions. Each individual project cost will be re-evaluated in light of the projected private development and resulting incremental tax revenues as it is considered for public financing under the provisions of the Act.
The amount of the total Redevelopment Project Costs that can be incurred in the Project Area will be reduced by the amount of Redevelopment Project Costs incurred in contiguous redevelopment project areas, or those separated from the Project Area only by a public right-of-way, that are permitted under the Act, the purpose of which is the redevelopment of Lathrop Homes, to be paid, and are paid, from incremental property taxes generated in the Project Area, but will not be reduced by the amount of Redevelopment Project Costs incurred in the Project Area which are paid from incremental property taxes generated in contiguous redevelopment project areas or those separated from the Project Area only by a public right-of-way.

All costs are shown in 2024 dollars and may be adjusted per the rate, adjusting for inflation reflected in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers for All Items for the Chicago-Gary-Kenosha, IL-IN-WI CMSA, published by the U.S. Department of Labor or a similar index acceptable to the City. Upon payment to the Developer of Total Redevelopment Project Costs, which may not exceed $60,000,000, as adjusted hereunder per the Act, the City will use its best efforts to adopt an ordinance, within 120 days, dissolving the special tax allocation fund for the Redevelopment Project Area and terminating the designation of the Redevelopment Project Area as a "redevelopment project area" under the terms of, and in accordance with, the Act.

It is anticipated that additional funding from other sources such as private, federal, state, county, or local funds may be utilized to supplement the City's ability to finance Redevelopment Project Costs, as defined above.

E. Sources of Funds to Pay Redevelopment Project Costs – no changes

F. Issuance of Obligations – no changes

G. Valuation of the Project Area

This subsection is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

1. Most Recent EAV of Properties In the Amended Project Area

The purpose of identifying the most recent equalized assessed valuation ("EAV") of the Amended Project Area is to provide an estimate of the initial EAV which the Cook County Clerk will certify for the purpose of annually calculating the incremental EAV and incremental property taxes of the Amended Project Area.

Original Area. According to the Cook County Clerk, the Certified Initial EAV (2015 tax year) of the Original Project Area is $0.

Expansion Area. The 2023 EAV of all taxable parcels in the Expansion Area is $818,814. This total EAV amount, by PIN, is summarized in Table 2. Amended Project Area EAV by PIN. The EAV is subject to verification by the Cook County Clerk. After verification, the final figure shall be certified by the Cook County Clerk and shall become the Certified Initial EAV from which all incremental property taxes in the Expansion Area will be calculated by Cook County. The Plan has utilized the EAVs for the 2023 tax year. If the 2024 EAV shall become available prior to the date of the adoption of the Plan by the City Council, the City may update the Plan by replacing the 2023 EAV with the 2024 EAV.

Amended Project Area. The estimated total Initial EAV of the Amended Project Area is $818,817.
Table 2 is deleted and replaced with the following:

2. Anticipated Equalized Assessed Valuation

By the tax year 2039 (collection year 2040) and following the substantial completion of the Redevelopment Project, the EAV of the Project Area is estimated to be $26,000,000. The estimate is based on several assumptions, including:

1) redevelopment of the Project Area will occur in a timely manner;
2) rehabilitation and/or construction and occupancy of 796 rental residential units, comprised of CHA, affordable and market rate units;
3) approximately 7,200 square feet of new retail/office space will be constructed or renovated within the existing Powerhouse; and
4) an estimated annual inflation rate in EAV of 2.5 percent through 2039, realized in triennial reassessment years only (7.69 percent per triennial reassessment period); and
5) the most recent state equalization factor of 3.0163 (2023 value) is used in all years to calculate estimated EAV.

SECTION VI. LACK OF GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT THROUGH INVESTMENT BY PRIVATE ENTERPRISE

Add the following language to the end of this section:

The Expansion Area qualifies under the Act as a conservation area on the basis that 1) it meets the age threshold; and 2) exhibits the meaningful presence and reasonable distribution of 6 of the 13 criteria listed in the Act for a conservation area. Therefore, the Amended Project Area is eligible under the Act as a redevelopment project area, with the meaningful presence and reasonable distribution of conservation area conditions that require excessive and disproportionate expenditure of public funds and are detrimental to sound growth and threaten the health, safety and welfare of the public.
The Amended Project Area on the whole has not been subject to growth and development through investment by private enterprise. The Amended Project Area would not reasonably be anticipated to be developed on a comprehensive and coordinated basis without the adoption of this Plan for the Amended Project Area.

SECTION XIII. HOUSING IMPACT
Add the following language to the end of this section:

The Redevelopment Plan generally outlines redevelopment activities that include substantial rehabilitation and historic preservation of existing buildings that may include select demolition as well as new construction. The Expansion Area includes a fully occupied senior high rise building and a recently constructed mid-rise apartment building that is in lease-up. All other buildings in the Expansion Area are 100% vacant. Based on the above, the City has certified that no displacement of residents will result from the Redevelopment Plan.

INTRODUCTION

On October 5, 2016, the Chicago City Council adopted the Diversey/Chicago River Tax Increment Financing Redevelopment Area Project and Plan ("Diversey/Chicago River TIF"). The Diversey/Chicago River TIF encompasses an irregularly-shaped area generally bounded on the east by Damen Avenue and Clybourn Avenue, on the north by Wellington Avenue, on the west by the north branch of the Chicago River and Leavitt Avenue, and on the south by an irregular line that lies between 214 feet and 354 feet south of Diversey Parkway and runs along the south line of the Lathrop Homes' buildings commonly numbered as 13, 6, and 2 (the "Original Area").

Through a public-private partnership between the Chicago Housing Authority (the "CHA"), Related Midwest and Bickerdike Housing (collectively, the "Developer"), 22 of the 33 buildings within the Julia C. Lathrop Homes public housing development ("Lathrop Homes") have been rehabilitated as a mixed-income housing development as part of Lathrop Homes Preservation Phase 1. In order to facilitate rehabilitation of the remainder of the Lathrop Homes complex, the City of Chicago proposes an amendment to the Diversey/Chicago River TIF to expand the boundaries.

In order to consider an amendment to the Diversey/Chicago River TIF in which the Original Area would be expanded, Johnson Research Group, Inc. ("JRG") was engaged by the CHA to determine whether an irregularly-shaped area of approximately 12.8 acres of land, located immediately south of the Original Area, qualifies for designation as a redevelopment project area based on findings for a "conservation area" and/or a "blighted area" within the requirements set forth in the Tax Increment Allocation Redevelopment Act (the "Act"). The Act is found in Illinois Compiled Statutes, Chapter 65, Act 5, Section 11-74.4-1 et. seq. as amended.

The expansion area examined in this report encompasses 11 of the 33 buildings that make up Lathrop Homes. This document, entitled the Diversey/Chicago River Expansion Area Tax Increment Financing Eligibility Report (the "Eligibility Report"), summarizes the methodology and findings of a study for an area generally bounded by Damen Avenue on the east, the Chicago River on the south and west, and on the north by an irregular line that lies between 214 feet and 354 feet south of Diversey Parkway and runs along the south line of the Lathrop Homes buildings commonly numbered as 13, 6, and 2. This area is referred to in this document as the Diversey/Chicago River Expansion Area Tax Increment Financing Redevelopment Project Area (the "Expansion Area"). The boundaries of the Expansion Area are shown on Figure 1.

The findings and conclusions presented in this report are based on surveys, documentation, and analyses conducted by JRG for the Expansion Area, as well as a review of documents provided by the Developer addressing physical conditions in the overall Lathrop Homes complex. The Eligibility Report summarizes the analyses and findings of JRG's work and research, which is the responsibility of JRG. The City is entitled to rely on the findings and conclusions of this Eligibility Report in designating the Expansion Area as a redevelopment project area under the Act. JRG has prepared this Eligibility Report and the related Redevelopment Project and Plan with the understanding that the City would rely on (i) the findings and conclusions of this Eligibility Report and the related Redevelopment Plan, and (ii) the fact that JRG has obtained the necessary information so that the Eligibility Report and related Redevelopment Plan will comply with the Act.

The determination of whether the Expansion Area qualifies for designation as a redevelopment project area based on findings of the area as a conservation area, or a blighted area, or a combination of both, pursuant to the Act is made by the City after careful review and consideration of the conclusions contained in this Eligibility Report.
The Expansion Area

The Expansion Area is approximately 12.8 acres in size and is located in the Lincoln Park community area. The Expansion Area includes 11 buildings located on 5 tax parcels originally built on an uncommonly large tax block, or "superblock." The 11 buildings in the Expansion Area include:

- a non-residential Powerhouse that provided steam heat to all original Lathrop Homes buildings;
- Waters Edge Apartments - a high rise building dedicated to CHA senior housing,
- a four-story residential building renovated as part of Lathrop Homes Preservation Phase 1; and
- eight (8) two-, three- and four-story buildings slated for renovation as part of the next phase of the Lathrop Homes Preservation Project.

Buildings and existing land uses in the Expansion Area are illustrated in Figure 3. Existing Land Use.

The Expansion Area as a whole is characterized by aging, deteriorated, and obsolete residential and public buildings. Lathrop Homes was originally built in the late 1930s and until 2016 had received only minor improvements. These buildings all exhibit severely deteriorated exterior conditions ranging from cracks and missing mortar in brickwork, crumbling concrete on porches and entryways, rusted window lintels, widespread graffiti and broken windows. The original heating system supplied by the Powerhouse building and serving all Lathrop Homes buildings has long been obsolete and inefficient for the development and is incompatible with contemporary standards for heating and cooling.

In addition to deterioration and obsolescence, the Expansion Area is characterized by long-term high vacancies, aging water and sewer utilities, and insufficient provision of off-street parking. The eight residential buildings subject to renovation have been largely vacant for more than 15 years. The majority of the water and sewer infrastructure serving the Expansion Area is nearly 90 years old and approaching its expected life. Finally, the Expansion Area suffers from a severe lack of off-street parking, as the area was developed in the 1930s when auto ownership was much less common than today. Except for a small parking area intended for the senior housing building, the southern portion of Lathrop Homes had no provision for off-street parking for the Lathrop Homes buildings south of Diversey Parkway.

Summary of Expansion Area Eligibility

For tax increment financing ("TIF") designation, an improved redevelopment project area must qualify for classification as a conservation area, a blighted area, or a combination of both blighted and conservation areas as set forth in the Act. Surveys and analyses documented in this report indicate that the Expansion Area is eligible as a conservation area within the requirements of the Act.

The Expansion Area qualifies as a conservation area under the improved property criteria as set forth in the Act. Specifically,

- 91% of the buildings are 35 years of age or older;
- Six conservation area factors are present to a meaningful extent and reasonably distributed throughout the entire Expansion Area. These include:
  1. Obsolescence
  2. Deterioration
  3. Structures Below Minimum Code Standards
4. Excessive Vacancies
5. Inadequate Utilities
6. Excessive Land Coverage and Overcrowding of Structures

Finally, the Expansion Area includes only real property and improvements that would be substantially benefited by the proposed redevelopment project improvements.

I. BASIS FOR REDEVELOPMENT

The Illinois General Assembly made these key findings in adopting the Act:

1. That there exists in many municipalities within the state blighted and conservation areas;
2. That as a result of the existence of blighted areas and areas requiring conservation, there is an excessive and disproportionate expenditure of public funds, inadequate public and private investment, unmarketability of property, growth in delinquencies and crime, and housing and zoning law violations in such areas together with an abnormal exodus of families and businesses so that the decline of these areas impairs the value of private investments and threatens the sound growth and the tax base of taxing districts in such areas and threatens the health, safety, morals and welfare of the public; and
3. That the eradication of blighted areas and the treatment and improvement of conservation areas by redevelopment projects are essential to the public interest.

To ensure that the exercise of these powers is proper and in the public interest, the Act also specifies certain requirements that must be met before a municipality can proceed with implementing a redevelopment project. One of these requirements is that the municipality must demonstrate that a prospective redevelopment project area qualifies either as a blighted area or as a conservation area pursuant to the definitions for each set forth in the Act (Section 11-74.4-3).

Blighted areas are defined as: 1) any improved area in which buildings or improvements are detrimental to the public safety, health or welfare because of a combination of 5 or more of the 13 improved area eligibility factors set forth in the Act; and 2) any vacant area in which its sound growth is impaired by the presence of one or two sets of criteria set forth in the Act.

Conservation areas are defined in the Act as any improved area in which 50% or more the structures have an age of 35 years and the improved area exhibits the presence of a combination of 3 or more of the 13 improved area eligibility factors set forth in the Act. Such an area is not yet a blighted area but if left unchecked, the presence of three or more such factors which are detrimental to the public safety, health or welfare, such an area may become a blighted area.

Improved Area Eligibility Criteria

Section 11-74.4.3 of the Act defines the 13 eligibility factors for improved areas. To support a designation as a blighted or conservation area each qualifying factor must be: (i) present to a meaningful extent and that presence documented so that the City may reasonably find that the factor is clearly present within the intent of the Act and (ii) reasonably distributed throughout the improved part of the Expansion Area.

1. Dilapidation
2. Obsolescence
3. Deterioration
4. Illegal use of individual structures
5. Presence of structures below minimum code standards
6. Excessive vacancies
7. Lack of ventilation, light, or sanitary facilities
8. Inadequate utilities
9. Excessive land coverage and overcrowding of structures and community facilities
10. Deleterious land-use or layout
11. Lack of community planning
12. Environmental remediation costs have been incurred or are required
13. Declining or lagging rate of growth of total equalized assessed valuation
It is also important to note that the test of eligibility is based on the conditions of the area as a whole; it is not required that eligibility be established for each and every property in the Expansion Area.

II. ELIGIBILITY SURVEY AND ANALYSIS

An analysis was made of each of the factors listed in the Act for conservation areas and blighted areas to determine whether each or any factors are present in the Expansion Area, and if so, to what extent and in what locations. Surveys and analyses conducted by JRG included:

1. Exterior survey of the condition and use of all buildings and sites and interior survey of selected buildings;
2. Field survey of physical conditions covering streets, sidewalks, curbs and gutters, lighting, parking facilities, landscaping, fences, and general property maintenance;
3. Analysis of existing uses within the Expansion Area and their relationships to the surroundings;
4. Comparison of current land use to current zoning ordinance and current zoning map;
5. Analysis of original platting and current parcel size and layout;
6. Analysis of vacant buildings;
7. Analysis of building floor area, site coverage, and off-street parking quantities;
8. Review of previously prepared plans, studies and data, including a physical needs assessment study prepared for CHA dated April 27, 2015;
9. Analysis of the City's building code violation data for the period from October 2007 through June 2024;
10. Analysis of storm and sanitary sewer lines and water infrastructure maps provided by the City's Department of Water Management; and
11. Analysis of Cook County Assessor records for years 2017 to 2023.

A statement of findings is presented for each factor listed in the Act. The conditions that exist and the relative extent to which each factor is present are described below.

A factor noted as "not present" indicates either that no information was available or that no evidence could be documented as part of the various surveys and analyses. A factor noted as "present to a meaningful extent" indicates that conditions exist which document that the factor is present throughout major portions of the Expansion Area and that the presence of such conditions have a major adverse impact or influence on adjacent and nearby development.

The following is the summary evaluation of the eligibility factors for the Expansion Area, presented in the order in which they appear in the Act.

III. IMPROVED AREA ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

In order to assess the "meaningful presence and reasonable distribution" of factors pursuant to the Act, TIF study areas are typically analyzed on a block-by-block basis. Since the Expansion Area consists of one superblock, the analysis below is based on the presence of factors on a building-by-building basis. As illustrated in Figures 2 through 9, the existing buildings are evenly
distributed throughout the Expansion Area. **Figure 2. Lathrop Home Building Numbering** presents the numbering system for all buildings within the Lathrop Homes site.

A. Age

Age is a primary and threshold criterion in determining an area's qualification for designation as a conservation area. Age presumes the existence of problems or limiting conditions resulting from normal and continuous use of structures over an extended period of years. Since building deterioration and related structural problems can be a function of time and climate, structures which are 35 years or older typically exhibit more problems and require greater maintenance than more recently constructed buildings.

Of the 11 buildings within the Expansion Area, 10 (91%) are 35 years of age or more.

**Conclusion:** The Expansion Area meets the required age test for designation as a conservation area. Ninety-one percent (91%) of the buildings within the Expansion Area exceed 35 years in age.

B. Dilapidation

Section 11-74.4-3 of the Act defines "Dilapidation" as follows: An advanced state of disrepair or neglect of necessary repairs to the primary structural components of buildings or improvements in such a combination that a documented building condition analysis determines that major repair is required or the defects are so serious and so extensive that the buildings must be removed.

This section summarizes the process used for assessing building conditions in the Expansion Area, the standards and criteria used for evaluation, and the findings as to the existence of Dilapidation or deterioration of structures. The building condition analysis is based on a thorough exterior inspection of the buildings and sites conducted in April and June 2024, documentation from an earlier interior inspection of select buildings in 2015, and documentation of building conditions and facility needs assessments provided by the CHA. Structural deficiencies in building components and related environmental deficiencies in the Expansion Area were noted during the inspections.

**Building Components Evaluated**

During the field surveys, each component of the buildings in the Expansion Area was examined to determine whether it was in sound condition or had minor, major or critical defects. Building components examined were of two types, primary structural and secondary, as described below.

- **Primary Structural Components**
  These include the basic elements of any building: foundation walls, load-bearing walls and columns, floors, roof and roof structure.

- **Secondary Components**
  These are components generally added to the primary structural components and are necessary parts of the building, including exterior and interior stairs, windows and window units, doors and door units, interior walls, porches and steps, chimneys, gutters and downspouts.

Each primary structural and secondary component are evaluated separately as a basis for determining the overall condition of individual buildings. This evaluation considers the relative importance of specific components within a building and the effect that deficiencies in components will have on the remainder of the building.
Building Component Classifications

The four categories for classifying building components and systems and the criteria for evaluating structural deficiencies are described below.

- **Sound**
  Building components that contain no defects, are adequately maintained and require no treatment outside of normal ongoing maintenance.

- **Deficient - Requiring Minor Repair**
  Building components containing defects (e.g. loose or missing material or holes and cracks over a limited area) which often may be corrected through the course of normal maintenance. Minor defects have no real effect on either primary structural or secondary components, and the correction of such defects may be accomplished by the owner or occupants, such as pointing masonry joints over a limited area or replacement of less complicated components. Minor defects are not considered in rating a building as structurally substandard.

- **Deficient - Requiring Major Repair**
  Building components which contain major defects over a widespread area and would be difficult to correct through normal maintenance. Buildings in the major deficient category would require replacement or rebuilding of components by people skilled in the building trades.

- **Critical**
  Building components that contain major defects (e.g. bowing, sagging or settling to any or all exterior components, causing the structure to be out-of-plumb, or broken, loose or missing material and deterioration over a widespread area) so extensive that the cost of repair would be excessive.

Final Building Rating

After completion of the exterior-interior building condition survey, each structure is placed in one of four categories based on the combination of defects found in various primary structural and secondary building components. Each final rating is described below:

- **Sound**
  Sound buildings can be kept in a standard condition with normal maintenance. Buildings so classified have no major or minor defects.

- **Deficient**
  Deficient buildings contain defects that collectively are not easily correctable and cannot be accomplished in the course of normal maintenance. The classification of major or minor reflects the degree or extent of defects found during the survey of the building.

  - **Minor** - one or more minor defect, but no major defect.
  - **Major** - one or more major defects in one of the primary components or in the combined secondary components, but no critical defect.

- **Substandard**
  Structurally substandard buildings contain defects that are so serious and so extensive that the building must be removed or major components substantially repaired and/or replaced. Buildings classified as structurally substandard have two or more major defects.

"Minor deficient" and "major deficient" buildings are considered to be the same as "deteriorating" buildings as referenced in the Act; "substandard" buildings are the same
as "dilapidated" buildings. The words "building" and "structure" are presumed to be interchangeable.

**Exterior Survey**

The condition of the buildings within the Expansion Area are based on observable components, as well as the documentation provided by CHA regarding historical exterior and interior conditions of the residential buildings. JRG conducted an exterior survey of each building within the Expansion Area to determine its condition. Based on this analysis, no buildings are identified as dilapidated. Of the 11 buildings in the Expansion Area:

- 2 buildings (18.2%) are classified as sound (no defects);
- 0 buildings (0.0%) are classified as minor deficient (deteriorating);
- 9 buildings (81.8%) are classified as major deficient (deteriorating); and
- 0 buildings (0.0%) are classified as structurally substandard (dilapidated).

**Conclusion:** No Presence of Factor. Dilapidation (structurally substandard buildings) as a factor is not present in the Expansion Area.

**C. Obsolescence**

Section 11-74.4-3 of the Act defines "Obsolescence" as follows: The condition or process of falling into disuse. Structures have become ill-suited for the original use.

In making findings with respect to buildings, it is important to distinguish between functional obsolescence, which relates to the physical utility of a structure, and economic obsolescence, which relates to a property's ability to compete in the market place.

**Functional Obsolescence**

Historically, structures have been built for specific uses or purposes. The design, location, height, and space arrangement are intended for a specific occupant at a given time. Buildings become obsolete when they contain characteristics or deficiencies which limit their use and marketability after the original use ceases. The characteristics may include loss in value to a property resulting from an inherent deficiency existing from poor design or layout, the improper orientation of the building on its site, etc., which detracts from the overall usefulness or desirability of a property.

**Economic Obsolescence**

Economic obsolescence is normally a result of adverse conditions which cause some degree of market rejection and, hence, depreciation in market values.

If functionally obsolete properties are not periodically improved or rehabilitated, or economically obsolete properties are not converted to higher and better uses, the income and value of the property erodes over time. This value erosion leads to deferred maintenance, deterioration and excessive vacancies. These manifestations of obsolescence then begin to have an overall blighting influence on surrounding properties and detract from the economic vitality of the overall area. Factors of obsolescence may include inadequate utility capacities, outdated building designs, etc.

Obsolescence as a factor should be based upon the documented presence and reasonable distribution of buildings and site improvements evidencing such obsolescence.

**Obsolete Building Types**

Obsolete buildings contain characteristics or deficiencies that limit their long-term sound use or reuse. Obsolescence in such buildings is typically difficult and expensive to correct.
All of the residential properties were built in 1938 as a unified public housing complex and reflect building components and systems that are outmoded and incompatible with contemporary development standards. The most significant example of obsolescence is the outdated and inadequate heating system in place. All buildings in the Lathrop Home complex were dependent on the Powerhouse building for centralized steam heat, leaving residents unable to control their own unit's heat and lacked cooling systems altogether. Buildings throughout the residential complex were constructed with uninsulated lobbies, stairwells and landings, doorways smaller than current standards, and outmoded, non-energy efficient windows. Most of the residential structures lack sufficient wall insulation causing heating/cooling inefficiencies year-round.

The residential structures in the Expansion Area are characterized by conditions that limit their efficient use and require substantial changes to update to contemporary standards. See Figure 4, Obsolescence.

**Conclusion:** Major Presence of Factor. The analysis indicates that Obsolescence is present to a meaningful extent in 9 of the 11 buildings and reasonably distributed throughout the Expansion Area.

**D. Deterioration**

Section 11-74.4-3 of the Act defines "Deterioration" as follows: With respect to buildings, defects including, but not limited to, major defects in the secondary building components such as doors, windows, porches, gutters and downspouts, and fascia. With respect to surface improvements, that the condition of roadways, alleys, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, off-street parking, and surface storage areas evidence deterioration, including, but not limited to, surface cracking, crumbling, potholes, depressions, loose paving material, and weeds protruding through paved surfaces.

Based on the definition given by the Act, deterioration refers to any physical deficiencies or disrepair in buildings or site improvements requiring treatment or repair.

- Deterioration may be evident in basically sound buildings containing minor defects, such as lack of painting, loose or missing materials, or holes and cracks over limited areas. This deterioration can be corrected through normal maintenance.
- Deterioration which is not easily correctable and cannot be accomplished in the course of normal maintenance may also be evident in buildings. Such buildings may be classified as minor deficient or major deficient buildings, depending upon the degree or extent of defects. This would include buildings with defects in the secondary building components (e.g., doors, windows, porches, gutters and downspouts, fascia materials, etc.), and defects in primary building components (e.g., foundations, frames, roofs, etc.), respectively.

**Deterioration of Buildings**

The analysis of building Deterioration is based on the survey methodology and criteria described in the Section on Dilapidation. Nine buildings within the Expansion Area are classified as exhibiting major deteriorating conditions. See Figure 3, Deterioration.

Nine buildings in the Expansion Area exhibit major levels of Deterioration among secondary components such as severely rusted lintels, deteriorated window frames, missing and boarded up doors, chipped and deteriorated front entrance steps, and widespread presence of broken windows and graffiti. Three of the buildings exhibit major defects to primary components of walls and foundation. Major deteriorating conditions include uneven and protruding brick with widespread need for tuck pointing and brick replacements.
An October 2015, interior inspection of Building 12 at the south end of the site revealed significant interior damage to public and private interior spaces, with no meaningful repairs made since that date. Major defects within private spaces included extensive water damage to ceiling, walls and floors of interior rooms, rusted radiator units, evidence of rodent infestation and loose and buckling bathroom tiles. Major defects in public stairwells include peeling paint over an extensive area as well as uneven or sagging concrete stairs.

Updated field surveys of the buildings documented completely broken/open windows on upper floors of nine of the 11 Expansion Area buildings creating unknown levels of interior deterioration due to extended exposure to rain and snow conditions.

Deterioration of Sites and Infrastructure

As part of the field survey, JRG documented site conditions that include extensive broken pavement, uneven paved surfaces within streets and sidewalks and deterioration of street pavement, curbs and gutters but found that such deteriorated site conditions were present to a limited extent in the Expansion Area.

Conclusion: Major Presence of Factor. Deterioration is present in nine of the 11 buildings in the Expansion Area. Therefore, Deterioration is meaningfully present and reasonably distributed throughout the Expansion Area.

E. Presence of Structures Below Minimum Code Standards

Section 11-74.4-3 of the Act defines the "Presence of structures below minimum code standards" as follows: All structures that do not meet the standards of zoning, subdivision, building, fire, and other governmental codes applicable to property, but not including housing and property maintenance codes.

As referenced in the definition above, the principal purposes of governmental codes applicable to properties are to require buildings to be constructed in such a way as to sustain safety of loads expected from the type of occupancy, to be safe for occupancy against fire and similar hazards and/or to establish minimum standards essential for safe and sanitary habitation. Structures below minimum code standards are characterized by defects or deficiencies that threaten health and safety.

One of the building codes particularly important for CHA properties are those designed to ensure compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. In the case of public housing units, all federally-assisted housing developments with five or more units must contain 5% of the dwelling units to be accessible for persons with mobility disabilities, and an additional 2% of the dwelling units must be accessible to persons with hearing or visual disabilities. These requirements are set forth in the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards ("UFAS").

EMG, an engineering firm located in Hunt Valley, Maryland, completed a comprehensive green physical needs assessment of the Lathrop Homes, dated April 27, 2015, which included assessments of the residential units' compliance with UFAS (the "EMG Study"), and no changes to the units have been made since that date. According to the EMG Study, eight of the 11 residential buildings in the Expansion Area meet the thresholds requiring accessibility (mobility or audio/visual) and, as such, fall below these UFAS building code standards.

The EMG Study documented the presence of structures below minimum code standards in eight of the 11 buildings of the Expansion Area. This factor is present to a meaningful extent and reasonably distributed throughout the Expansion Area. See Figure 6, Buildings Below Minimum Code Standards.
Conclusion: Major Presence of Factor. The analysis indicates that structures below minimum code standards is present to a meaningful extent and is reasonably distributed throughout the Expansion Area.

F. Illegal Use of Individual Structures

Section 11-74.4-3 of the Act defines "illegal use of individual structures" as follows: The use of structures in violation of applicable federal, State, or local laws, exclusive of those applicable to the presence of structures below minimum code standards.

Violation of federal, State or local laws were not evident as part of the exterior field survey conducted as part of this Eligibility Study.

Conclusion: No Presence of Factor. No condition pertaining to illegal uses of individual structures has been documented as part of the interior and exterior surveys and analyses undertaken within the Expansion Area. This factor is not a supporting factor for Expansion Area eligibility.

G. Excessive Vacancies

Section 11-74.4-3 of the Act defines "excessive vacancies" as follows: The presence of buildings that are unoccupied or under-utilized and that represent an adverse influence on the area because of the frequency, extent, or duration of the vacancies.

Vacancies are present to a major extent based on an exterior field survey and on information provided by the CHA. Eight of the residential buildings in the Expansion Area are 100% vacant and the Powerhouse building is no longer functioning as the heating system for the complex. The residential buildings have been largely vacant for over 15 years, creating a long-term and ongoing blight on the Expansion Area and the surrounding neighborhood. For purposes of this report, a building is characterized as exhibiting "excessive vacancies" if more than 20% of its units are vacant. Under these definitions, nine of the 11 buildings of the Expansion Area exhibit excessive vacancies.

The two buildings in the Expansion Area that do not exhibit excessive vacancies include the fully occupied Waters Edge Senior Building and the newly redeveloped building at 2737 N Hoyne that is currently in lease up.

Excessive vacancies, exhibited by exceptionally high levels and extended duration of vacancies in the Expansion Area, have a detrimental impact on the neighborhood and all its residents. High vacancy levels can attract squatters who break into the units as well as rodents (commonly found near the river) and also reduces the safety and security of residents due to the reduced presence of residents and visitors. See Figure 7, Excessive Vacancies.

Conclusion: Major Presence of Factor. Excessive vacancies as a factor is present to a meaningful extent and reasonably distributed throughout the Expansion Area.
H. Lack of Ventilation, Light, or Sanitary Facilities

Section 11-74.4-3 of the Act defines "lack of ventilation, light, or sanitary facilities" as follows: The absence of adequate ventilation for light or air circulation in spaces or rooms without windows, or that require the removal of dust, odor, gas, smoke, or other noxious airborne materials. Inadequate natural light and ventilation means the absence or inadequacy of skylights or windows for interior spaces or rooms and improper window sizes and amounts by room area to window area ratios. Inadequate sanitary facilities refers to the absence or inadequacy of garbage storage and enclosure, bathroom facilities, hot water and kitchens, and structural inadequacies preventing ingress and egress to and from all rooms and units within a building.

A comprehensive interior inspection of conditions is required to determine the presence of this factor. Limited inspections of selected buildings were conducted in earlier years but did not document presence of this factor. Sufficient ingress/egress and the presence of sufficient window openings was present from an exterior field survey.

Conclusion: No Presence of Factor. No condition pertaining to a lack of ventilation, light, or sanitary facilities has been documented as part of the exterior surveys and analyses undertaken within the Expansion Area. This factor is not present in the Expansion Area.

I. Inadequate Utilities

Section 11-74.4-3 of the Act defines "inadequate utilities" as follows: Underground and overhead utilities such as storm sewers and storm drainage, sanitary sewers, water lines, and gas, telephone, and electrical services that are shown to be inadequate. Inadequate utilities are those that are: (i) of insufficient capacity to serve the uses in the redevelopment project area, (ii) deteriorated, antiquated, obsolete, or in disrepair, or (iii) lacking within the redevelopment project area.

Sewer and water lines typically have useful life expectancies of approximately 100 years. Review and analysis of the City's water and sewer atlases for the pipes that serve the Expansion Area document that water and sewer lines are nearing the end of their useful life. Both water and sewer lines that run through the Expansion Area were put in place in 1937 and have not been replaced or relined since that time. See Figure 8. Inadequate Utilities.

Conclusion: Major Presence of Factor. Inadequate utilities, as a factor, impacts all 11 buildings and is present to a meaningful extent and reasonably distributed throughout the Expansion Area.

J. Excessive Land Coverage & Overcrowding of Structures and Community Facilities

Section 11-74.4-3 of the Act defines "excessive land coverage and overcrowding of structures and community facilities" as follows: The over-intensive use of property and the crowding of buildings and accessory facilities onto a site. Examples of problem conditions warranting the designation of an area as one exhibiting excessive land coverage are: the presence of buildings either improperly situated on parcels or located on parcels of inadequate size and shape in relation to present-day standards of development for health and safety and the presence of multiple buildings on a single parcel. For there to be a finding of excessive land coverage, these parcels must exhibit one or more of the following conditions: insufficient provision for light and air within or around buildings, increased threat of spread of fire due to the close proximity of buildings, lack of adequate or proper access to a public right-of-way, lack of reasonable required off-street parking, or inadequate provision for loading and service.
Excessive land coverage and overcrowding of structures and community facilities is present in the Expansion Area based on the lack of sufficient off-street parking spaces. The residential complex was planned and built in the 1930s when the designers did not anticipate modern rates of car ownership and use. The original development created one off-street parking space for every 15 residential units with those parking lots inconveniently located on a gravel lot between Hoyne and Damen. Over the years, reconstruction and widening of Damen Avenue eliminated that parking lot, leaving the southern portion of the Lathrop Homes development with no off-street parking for residents in buildings south of Diversey Parkway.

The Waters Edge Senior Building has gated parking that is limited to its residents and employees. The redevelopment of 2737 N Hoyne incorporated ground floor parking in its design introducing off-street, garage parking spaces for residents of the building and neighboring buildings.

The dearth of off-street parking spaces is so severe and impactful throughout the entire complex that this is considered a major presence of this factor. Until sufficient number and distribution of parking spaces can be accommodated, this factor impacts all of the buildings in the Expansion Area to a significant extent. Any redevelopment of the Expansion Area would have to add hundreds of off-street parking spaces in order to meet the City's modern zoning codes. See Figure 9. Excessive Land Coverage/Overcrowding of Buildings and Community Facilities.

**Conclusion:** Major Presence of Factor. Excessive land coverage and overcrowding of structures and community facilities is present to a meaningful extent and is reasonably distributed throughout the Expansion Area.

**K. Deleterious Land Use or Layout**

Section 11-74.4-3 of the Act defines "deleterious land-use or layout" as follows: The existence of incompatible land-use relationships, buildings occupied by inappropriate mixed-uses, or uses considered to be noxious, offensive, or unsuitable for the surrounding area.

The non-residential buildings in the Expansion Area are complimentary and compatible with the residential buildings, and the land uses are consistent with the City's zoning code and do not result in inappropriate mix of uses.

**Conclusion:** No Presence of Factor. Deleterious land-use or layout has not been documented as present in the Expansion Area.

**L. Lack of Community Planning**

Section 11-74.4-3 of the Act defines "lack of community planning" as follows: The proposed redevelopment project area was developed prior to or without the benefit or guidance of a community plan. This means that the development occurred prior to the adoption by the municipality of a comprehensive or other community plan or that the plan was not followed at the time of the area's development. This factor must be documented by evidence of adverse or incompatible land-use relationships, inadequate street layout, improper subdivision, parcels of inadequate shape and size to meet contemporary development standards, or other evidence demonstrating an absence of effective community planning.

The City of Chicago was incorporated in 1837 and expanded in population and geography well into the 20th century. With the adoption of the Burnham Plan in 1909, the City established a pattern of streets and boulevards on a grid system with residential, commercial and confined industrial areas separated by major rail lines, commercial corridors and parks connected by green boulevards. Lathrop Homes was planned and built in the 1930s as a planned community for the working poor and won great praise for its layout and overall design.
Conclusion: No Presence of Factor. Lack of community planning has not been documented in the Expansion Area.

M. Environmental Remediation

Section 11-74.4-3 of the Act defines "environmental remediation" as follows: The area has incurred Illinois Environmental Protection Agency or United States Environmental Protection Agency remediation costs for, or a study conducted by an independent consultant recognized as having expertise in environmental remediation has determined a need for, the clean-up of hazardous waste, hazardous substances, or underground storage tanks required by State or federal law, provided that the remediation costs constitute a material impediment to the development or redevelopment of the redevelopment project area.

The Expansion Area does not contain any properties or Long-term Cleanup Sites on the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Region 5 Superfund website and does not contain any Leaking Underground Storage Tanks tracked via the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency's Leaking Incident Database. The Green Physical Needs Assessment Report dated April 27, 2015 documents that visible suspected mold growth has been present in one or more properties and indoor air quality or mold-related complaints were received from residents. However, no additional details or documentation were available for this study.

Conclusion: No Presence of Factor. The condition pertaining to a need for environmental remediation has not been sufficiently documented for qualification as a supporting eligibility factor in the Expansion Area.

N. Declining or Lagging Equalized Assessed Valuation

Section 11-74.4-3 of the Act defines "declining or lagging equalized assessed valuation" as follows: The total equalized assessed value of the proposed redevelopment project area has declined for 3 of the last 5 calendar years for which information is available or is increasing at an annual rate that is less than the balance of the municipality for 3 of the last 5 calendar years for which information is available or is increasing at an annual rate that is less than the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the United States Department of Labor or successor agency for 3 of the last 5 calendar years for which information is available.

Over the period from 2018 to 2023, the growth rate of the total EAV of the Expansion Area has declined in two of the last five years and lagged behind the growth rate of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in all three of those years. However, the majority of the Expansion Area has been exempt for most of this time period, so the declining trend is not considered reasonably distributed throughout the Expansion Area. Therefore, this factor is not considered present in the Expansion Area.

The EAV figures are shown below in Table 1. Growth of Expansion Area vs. Consumer Price Index.
Table 1. Growth of Expansion Area vs. Consumer Price Index

| Year | Expansion Area EAV | Percent Change | Declining EAV | CPI December Value | Percent Change | Lagging CPI |
|------|--------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------------|----------------|-------------|
| 2018 | 33,935             |                | NO            | 251.233            | 1.9%           |             |
| 2019 | 393,963            | 1060.9%        | NO            | 256.974            | 2.3%           | NO          |
| 2020 | 1,347,965          | 242.2%         | NO            | 260.474            | 1.4%           | NO          |
| 2021 | 1,254,036          | -7.0%          | YES           | 278.802            | 7.0%           | YES         |
| 2022 | 793,679            | -36.7%         | YES           | 296.797            | 6.5%           | YES         |
| 2023 | 818,814            | 3.2%           | NO            | 306.746            | 3.4%           | YES         |

1. 2023 is the most recent year for which finalized data is available for the Expansion Area and CPI.
2. Percent Change reflects the annual growth in EAV from the prior year (e.g. 3.2% change in Expansion Area EAV for Year 2023 represents the change in EAV from 2022 to 2023).

Conclusion: No Presence of Factor. Declining or Lagging Equalized Assessed Valuation as a factor is not considered a supporting eligibility factor.

IV. DETERMINATION OF EXPANSION AREA ELIGIBILITY

The Expansion Area meets the requirements of the Act for designation as a conservation area.

A. Age

The Expansion Area meets the threshold criteria, which requires that 50% or more of buildings are 35 years of age or older. Ninety-one percent (91%) of the Expansion Area's buildings are 35 years of age or older.

B. Conservation Area Criteria

The meaningful presence and reasonable distribution of a minimum of three of the 13 factors set forth in the Act are required for the Expansion Area to qualify for designation as a conservation area. The analysis of the Expansion Area finds a meaningful presence and a reasonable distribution of six factors throughout the Expansion Area, including:

1. Obsolescence
2. Deterioration
3. Structures Below Minimum Code Standards
4. Excessive Vacancies
5. Inadequate Utilities
6. Excessive Land Coverage and Overcrowding of Structures

The summary of conservation area factors is documented on a building-by-building basis in Table 2: Distribution of Factors by Building.
Table 2. Distribution of Factors by Building

| Building No. | Land Use   | Dilapidation | Obsolescence | Dereliction | Illegal Use | Struct. below code | Excess. Vacancies | Excess. Land coverage/Overcrowding | Lack of Light, Vent. | Deteriorating Utilities | Deteriorating Environment | Declining/Sluggish EAV | Declining Community Planning |

The eligibility findings presented in this report indicate that the Expansion Area is in need of revitalization and guided growth to ensure that it will contribute to the long-term physical, economic and social well-being of the City. The Expansion Area contains properties and buildings of various sizes that are advancing in obsolescence and deterioration. Existing vacancies, inadequate utilities, building code violations, insufficient off-street parking and other conservation factors, as identified above, indicate that the Expansion Area as a whole has not been subject to growth and development through investment by private enterprise and would not reasonably be anticipated to be developed without public action.

BE IT RESOLVED BY THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION OF THE CITY OF CHICAGO:

Section 1. The above recitals are incorporated herein and made a part hereof.

Section 2. The Commission hereby makes the following findings pursuant to Section 5/11-74.4-3(n) of the Act or such other section as is referenced herein:

a. The Area on the whole has not been subject to growth and development through investment by private enterprise and would not reasonably be expected to be developed without the adoption of the Plan;
b. The Plan:
   i. conforms to the comprehensive plan for the development of the City as a whole; or
   ii. the Plan either (A) conforms to the strategic economic development or redevelopment plan issued by the Chicago Plan Commission or (B) includes land uses that have been approved by the Chicago Plan Commission;

c. The Plan meets all of the requirements of a redevelopment plan as defined in the Act and, as set forth in the Plan, the estimated date of completion of the projects described therein and retirement of all obligations issued to finance redevelopment project costs is not later than December 31 of the year in which the payment to the municipal treasurer as provided in subsection (b) of Section 5/11-74.4-8 of the Act is to be made with respect to ad valorem taxes levied in the twenty-third calendar year following the year of the adoption of the ordinance approving the designation of the Area as a redevelopment project area and, as required pursuant to Section 5/11-74.4-7 of the Act, no such obligation shall have a maturity date greater than 20 years;

d. To the extent required by Section 5/11-74.4-3(n) (6) of the Act, the Plan incorporates the housing impact study, if such study is required by Section 5/11-74.4-3(n)(5) of the Act;

e. The Plan will not result in displacement of residents from inhabited units.

f. The Area includes only those contiguous parcels of real property and improvements thereon that are to be substantially benefited by proposed Plan improvements, as required pursuant to Section 5/11-74.4-4(a) of the Act;

g. As required pursuant to Section 5/11-74.4-3(p) of the Act:
   i. The Area is not less, in the aggregate, than one and one-half acres in size; and
   ii. Conditions exist in the Area that cause the Area to qualify for designation as a redevelopment project area and a blighted area as defined in the Act;

h. If the Area is qualified as a “blighted area”, whether improved or vacant, each of the factors necessary to qualify the Area as a Redevelopment Project Area on that basis is (i) present, with that presence documented to a meaningful extent so that it may be reasonably found that the factor is clearly present within the intent of the Act and (ii) reasonably distributed throughout the improved part or vacant part, as applicable, of the Area as required pursuant to Section 5/11-74.4-3(a) of the Act;
i. If the Area is qualified as a "conservation area" the combination of the factors necessary to qualify the Area as a redevelopment project area on that basis is detrimental to the public health, safety, morals or welfare, and the Area may become a blighted area; [and]

Section 3. The Commission recommends that the City Council approve the Plan pursuant to Section 5/11-74.4-4 of the Act.

Section 4. The Commission recommends that the City Council designate the Area as a Redevelopment Project Area pursuant to Section 5/11-74.4-4 of the Act.

Section 5. The Commission recommends that the City Council adopt Tax Increment Allocation Financing within the Area.

Section 6. If any provision of this resolution shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect any of the remaining provisions of this resolution.

Section 7. All resolutions, motions or orders in conflict with this resolution are hereby repealed to the extent of such conflict.

Section 8. This resolution shall be effective as of the date of its adoption.

Section 9. A certified copy of this resolution shall be transmitted to the City Council.

CAPITAL GRANT PAYMENT

The Capital Grant may be disbursed as progress payments through a project escrow, or as a single, 100% reimbursement upon project completion. The Finalist must select a payment method before executing the RDA.

Project Escrow

Grantees may establish a project escrow account at their own cost, and receive four, incremental disbursements of their Capital Grant during construction. The fourth, and final, disbursement is provided following the completion of the Project and DPD's issuance of a Certificate of Completion ("Certificate"). Each escrow draw requires review and approval of Grantee's documentation by DPD. Grantees who elect to receive their Capital Grant via a project escrow must execute an escrow agreement with DPD and the title company concurrently with the execution of the RDA.

Single Reimbursement

Grantees may receive a one-time disbursement of 100% of their Capital Grant following the completion of the Project and DPD's issuance of the Certificate.

GRANT STRUCTURE

Before any City Grant funds are disbursed, Grantees will be required to submit evidence of eligible costs.

Base Grant

Rehabilitation projects are eligible to receive up to 50% of total project costs. New construction projects are eligible to receive up to 30% of total project costs, to the extent that eligible costs such as land acquisition or site preparation are documented. In no case may the total Capital Grant exceed the program's $2.5 million grant limit.

Ineligible project costs include furnishings, fixtures and equipment (FF&E); fees generally related to accounting, marketing, permitting, equipment rental, or construction management; and hard and soft contingencies unrelated to eligible project costs.

Local Residency Bonus

Finalists whose officer's or owner's primary residence is located within the Qualified Investment Area ("QIA") are eligible for a funding bonus of up to 25% of the total project cost, but not to exceed a total of $250,000, inclusive of the $2.5 million grant limit. Finalists who are interested in this bonus must submit two of the following four items as proof of residency by Friday, November 1, 2024:

Task 1: Capacity Assessments. The Project Manager and its consultants will assess each corridor manager organization’s capacity to lead and participate in corridor development projects, with a focus on board expertise and strategic vision for the Priority Corridors. The assessments will include a review of key documents, interviews with board members and organization leadership, and analysis of each organization’s corridor development-related programming. The organization’s participation in the assessment process will be considered a requirement for ongoing participation in the program and to gain access to resources to advance corridor project goals:
1. The Project Manager will report detailing existing capacity and expertise of current corridor manager organizations to take on development projects in leading or supporting roles; and

Task 2: Preparing Corridor Managers To Take On Physical Development Projects. The Project Manager and its consultants will lay the groundwork for corridor managers to lead and support physical development and infrastructure projects. The subtasks and deliverables for this task may include:

1. Compile a list of feasible physical improvements on each corridor that can be completed in one year or less;

2. Create a list of corridor assets and vacancies;

3. Develop a framework for funding projects, including cataloging public grant and incentive timelines, coordinating with the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity and with Cook County, and sharing the program with philanthropic and banking partners;

4. Create a rubric of minimum organizational needs for driving corridor development;

5. Adapt the Project Manager’s emerging developer curriculum to suit the corridor manager audience and pilot delivery of several modules; and

6. Complete a workplan outline for a new multi-year program to start in 2026, subject to City Council approval.

Task 3: Final Structure For Corridor Manager Program Starting In 2026. Building on Task 1 and Task 2, the final programmatic task is the creation of a program structure and goals for the next corridor manager program. Subject to City Council approval, the next program would give the Project Manager and the corridor managers clear goals and milestones for 2026 -- 2030.

If the Developer has not fulfilled its obligation, DPD will issue a written statement detailing the measures which must be taken in order to obtain them.

DPD may require a single inspection by an inspecting architect hired at the Developer's expense to confirm the completion of the Project. DPD shall make its best efforts to respond to Developer's written request for the Certificate within forty-five (45) days by issuing the Certificate or a written statement detailing the ways in which the Project does not conform to this Agreement or has not been satisfactorily completed, and the measures which must be taken by Developer in order to obtain the Certificate.

Those covenants specifically described at Sections 6.02, 6.03, 6.04, 6.05 and 6.06 as covenants that run with the land will bind any transferee of the Property throughout the Term of the Agreement or such shorter period as may be explicitly provided for therein. The other executory terms of this Agreement shall be binding only upon the Developer or a permitted assignee of this Agreement.

5.03 Failure to Complete. If the Developer fails to complete the Project in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and/or if the Developer has not received the Certificate by the Certificate Deadline, the Certificate will not be issued, and the City will have the right to pursue any available legal remedies.

Developer represents that it understands and will abide by all provisions of Chapter 2-56 of the Municipal Code and that it will inform subcontractors of this provision and require their compliance.

6.13 Non-Governmental Charges. The Developer agrees to pay or cause to be paid when due any Non-Governmental Charges. The Developer has the right, before any delinquency occurs, to contest any Non-Governmental Charge by appropriate legal proceedings properly and diligently prosecuted, so long as such proceedings serve to prevent any sale or forfeiture of the Property.

6.14 Governmental Charges.

(a) Payment of Governmental Charges. Developer agrees to pay or cause to be paid when due all Governmental Charges (as defined below) which are assessed or imposed upon Developer, the Property or the Project, or become due and payable, and which create, may create, a lien upon Developer or all or any portion of the Property or the Project. "Governmental Charge" shall mean all federal, State, county, the City, or other governmental (or any instrumentality, division, agency, body, or department thereof) taxes, levies, assessments, charges, liens, claims or encumbrances (except for those assessed by foreign nations, states other than the State of Illinois, counties of the State other than Cook County, and municipalities other than the City) relating to Developer, the Property or the Project including but not limited to real estate taxes.

(b) Right to Contest. Developer has the right before any delinquency occurs to contest or object in good faith to the amount or validity of any Governmental Charge by appropriate legal proceedings properly and diligently instituted and prosecuted in such manner as shall stay the collection of the contested Governmental Charge and prevent the imposition of a lien or the sale or forfeiture of the Property. No such contest or objection shall be deemed or construed in any way as relieving, modifying or extending Developer's covenants to pay any such Governmental Charge at the time and in the manner provided in this Agreement unless Developer has given prior written notice to DPD of Developer's intent to contest or object to a Governmental Charge and, unless, at DPD's sole option:

(i) Developer shall demonstrate to DPD's satisfaction that legal proceedings instituted by Developer contesting or objecting to a Governmental Charge shall conclusively operate to prevent or remove a lien against, or the sale or forfeiture of, all or any part of the Property to satisfy such Governmental Charge prior to final determination of such proceedings; and/or
(ii) Developer shall furnish a good and sufficient bond or other security satisfactory to DPD in such form and amounts as DPD shall require, or a good and sufficient undertaking as may be required or permitted by law to accomplish a stay of any such sale or forfeiture of the Property during the pendency of such contest, adequate to pay fully any such contested Governmental Charge and all interest and penalties upon the adverse determination of such contest.

6.15 Developer's Failure To Pay Or Discharge Lien. If Developer fails to pay any Governmental Charge or to obtain discharge of the same, Developer shall advise DPD thereof in writing, at which time DPD may, but shall not be obligated to, and without waiving or releasing any obligation or liability of Developer under this Agreement, in DPD's sole discretion, make such payment, or any part thereof, or obtain such discharge and take any other action with respect thereto which DPD deems advisable. All sums so paid by DPD, if any, and any expenses, if any, including reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, expenses and other charges relating thereto, shall be promptly disbursed to DPD by Developer. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, this paragraph shall not be construed to obligate the City to pay any such Governmental Charge. Additionally, if Developer fails to pay any Governmental Charge, the City, in its sole discretion, may require Developer to submit to the City audited Financial Statements at Developer's own expense.

6.16 FOIA and Local Records Act Compliance.

(a) FOIA. The Developer acknowledges that the City is subject to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act, 5 ILCS 140/1 et. seq., as amended (“FOIA”). The FOIA requires the City to produce records (very broadly defined in FOIA) in response to a FOIA request in a very short period of time, unless the records requested are exempt under the FOIA. If the Developer receives a request from the City to produce records within the scope of FOIA, then the Developer covenants to comply with such request within 48 hours of the date of such request. Failure by the Developer to timely comply with such request shall be an Event of Default.

(b) Exempt Information. Documents that the Developer submits to the City with the Annual Compliance Report or otherwise during the Term of the Agreement that contain trade secrets and commercial or financial information may be exempt if disclosure would result in competitive harm. However, for documents submitted by the Developer to be treated as a trade secret or information that would cause competitive harm, FOIA requires that Developer mark any such documents as "proprietary, privileged or confidential." If the Developer marks a document as "proprietary, privileged and confidential", then DPD will evaluate whether such document may be withheld under the FOIA. DPD, in its discretion, will determine whether a document will be exempted from disclosure, and that determination is subject to review by the Illinois Attorney General's Office and/or the courts.

(c) Local Records Act. The Developer acknowledges that the City is subject to the Local Records Act, 50 ILCS 205/1 et. seq, as amended (the “Local Records Act”). The Local Records Act provides that public records may only be disposed of as provided in the Local Records Act. If requested by the City, the Developer covenants to use its best efforts consistently applied to assist the City in its compliance with the Local Records Act.
SECTION 7. MAINTAINING RECORDS AND RIGHT TO INSPECT

7.01 Books and Records. The Developer, the general contractor and each subcontractor shall keep and maintain books and records that fully disclose the total actual cost of the Project and the disposition of all funds from whatever source allocated thereto and as otherwise necessary to evidence the Developer's compliance with its obligations under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, payroll records, general contractor's and subcontractors' sworn statements, general contracts, subcontracts, purchase orders, waivers of lien, paid receipts and invoices and the like. Such books and records shall be available at the applicable party's offices for inspection, copying, audit and examination by an authorized representative of the City, at the Developer's expense.

7.02 Inspection Rights. Upon three (3) business days' notice, any authorized representative of the City has access to all portions of the Project and the Property during normal business hours for the Term of the Agreement.

SECTION 8. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

The Developer hereby represents and warrants to the City that it has conducted environmental studies sufficient to conclude that the Project may be constructed, completed and operated in accordance with the requirements of all Environmental Laws and this Agreement. The Developer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the City harmless from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, injuries, costs, expenses or claims of any kind whatsoever including, without limitation, any losses, liabilities, damages, injuries, costs, expenses or claims asserted or arising under any Environmental Laws incurred, suffered by or asserted against the City and relating to the Project or the Property.

SECTION 9. INDEMNIFICATION

Developer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the City, its officers, officials, members, agents and employees harmless from and against any and all losses, costs, damages, liabilities, claims, suits, judgments, demands, actions, causes of action of every kind or nature and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and court costs) arising out of or incidental to the failure of Developer to perform its obligations under this Agreement. Upon reasonable notice from the City of any claim which the City believes to be covered hereunder, Developer shall timely appear in and defend all suits brought upon such claim and shall pay all costs and expenses incidental thereto, but the City shall have the right, at its option and at its own expense, to participate in the defense of any suit, without relieving Developer of any of its obligations hereunder. The obligations set forth in this section shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.

SECTION 10. DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

10.01 Events of Default. The occurrence of any one or more of the following events, subject to the provisions of Section 6 (Covenants, Representations, and Warranties of Developer), shall constitute an "Event of Default" by the Developer hereunder:

(a) the failure of Developer to complete the Project in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;
(b) the failure of the Developer to comply with any covenant or obligation, or the breach by
the Developer of any representation or warranty, under this Agreement or any related agreement;

(c) the making or furnishing by Developer to the City of any representation, warranty,
certificate, schedule, report or other communication within or in connection with this Agreement or any
related agreement which is untrue or misleading in any material respect;

(d) the commencement of any bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or reorganization
proceedings under any applicable state or federal law, or the commencement of any analogous statutory
or non-statutory proceedings involving the Developer; provided, however, that if such commencement of
proceedings is involuntary, such action shall not constitute an Event of Default unless such proceedings
are not dismissed within sixty (60) days after the commencement of such proceedings;

(e) the appointment of a receiver or trustee for the Developer, for any substantial part of the
Developer's assets or the institution of any proceedings for the dissolution, or the full or partial liquidation,
or the merger or consolidation, of the Developer; provided, however, that if such appointment or
commencement of proceedings is involuntary, such action shall not constitute an Event of Default unless
such appointment is not revoked or such proceedings are not dismissed within sixty (60) days after the
commencement thereof;

(f) the entry of any judgment or order against the Developer or the Property which remains
unsatisfied or undischarged and in effect for sixty (60) days after such entry without a stay of enforcement
or execution; or

(g) the dissolution of the Developer or the death of any natural person who owns a 50% or
more ownership interest in the Developer, unless, in the case of a death, the Developer establishes to the
DPD's satisfaction that such death shall not impair the Developer's ability to perform its executory
obligations under this Agreement.

10.02 Remedies. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the City may seek revocation of
the Tax Incentive pursuant to the County Tax Incentive Ordinance, terminate this Agreement and all
related agreements, and/or, in any court of competent jurisdiction by any action or proceeding at law or
in equity, pursue and secure any other available remedy.

10.03 Cure Period. (a) In the event Developer shall fail to perform a monetary covenant which
Developer is required to perform under this Agreement, notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, an Event of Default shall not be deemed to have occurred unless Developer
has failed to perform such monetary covenant within ten (10) days of its receipt of a written notice from
the City specifying that it has failed to perform such monetary covenant.

(b) Developer shall be entitled to one 18-month cure period, which can be extended an additional

commencing on the date of issuance of the Certificate for failure to perform under Section 6.04
(Occupancy Covenant) and Section 6.05 (Jobs Covenant). Any cure period under this Section 10.03(b) shall
not count toward the Compliance Period of this Agreement. If one failure to perform under either Section
6.04 or Section 6.05 has occurred and been cured as set forth in this Section 10.03(b), then any subsequent failure to perform under either Section 6.04 or Section 6.05 shall constitute an Event of Default.

(c) In the event Developer shall fail to perform any other non-monetary covenant which Developer is required to perform under this Agreement, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, an Event of Default shall not be deemed to have occurred unless Developer has failed to cure such default within thirty (30) days of its receipt of a written notice from the City specifying the nature of the default; provided, however, with respect to those non-monetary defaults which are not capable of being cured within such thirty (30) day period, Developer shall not be deemed to have committed an Event of Default under this Agreement if it has commenced to cure the alleged default within such thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently and continuously prosecutes the cure of such default until the same has been cured; provided, further, that there shall be no cure period under this Section 10.03 with respect to Developer's failure to comply with Section 6.03 (Operations Covenant).

Construction Compliance.

Agreements With Contractors.

1. Bid Requirement For General Contractor And Subcontractors. Prior to entering into an agreement with a General Contractor or any subcontractor for construction of the Project, Developer shall solicit, or shall cause the General Contractor to solicit, bids from qualified contractors eligible to do business with, and having an office located in, the City of Chicago, and shall submit all bids received to DPD, if requested, for its inspection and written approval. (i) Developer shall select the General Contractor (or shall cause the General Contractor to select the subcontractor) submitting the lowest responsible bid who can complete the Project in a timely manner.

2. Construction Contract. Prior to the Closing Date, the Developer must provide DPD with a certified copy of the construction contract, together with any modifications, amendments, or supplements thereto, and upon DPD’s request, a copy of any subcontracts. Photocopies of all contracts or subcontracts entered or to be entered into in connection with the Project shall be provided to DPD within five (5) business days of the execution thereof.
3. Performance And Payment Bonds. Prior to the commencement of any portion of the Project which includes work on the public way, the Developer must require the General Contractor to be bonded for its payment by sureties having an AA rating or better using a bond in a form acceptable to the City. The City shall be named as obligee or co-obligee on any such bonds.

4. Employment Profile. Upon DPD’s request, the Developer, the General Contractor, and all subcontractors must submit to DPD statements of their respective employment profiles. Developer shall contractually obligate and cause the General Contractor and each subcontractor to agree to the Construction Hiring Requirements.

In addition to the requirements of Agreements with Contractors, the Construction Contract and each contract with any subcontractor shall contain provisions required pursuant to Section 3.05 (Change Orders), (Sub)Exhibit E Construction Hiring Requirements, and Section 9.01 (Books and Records) of the RDA.

Construction Hiring Requirements.

1. Employment Opportunity. The Developer shall contractually obligate its or their various contractors, subcontractors or any Affiliate of the Developer operating on the Property (collectively, with the Developer, the “Employers” and individually an “Employer”) to agree, that for the Term of this Agreement with respect to Developer and during the period of any other party’s provision of services in connection with the construction of the Project or occupation of the Property:

(a) No Employer shall discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment based upon race, religion, color, sex, national origin or ancestry, age, handicap or disability, sexual orientation, military discharge status, marital status, parental status or source of income as defined in the City of Chicago Human Rights Ordinance, Chapter 2-160, Section 2-160-010, et seq., Municipal Code, except as otherwise provided by said ordinance and as amended from time to time (the “Human Rights Ordinance”). Each Employer shall take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are hired and employed without discrimination based upon race, religion, color, sex, national origin or ancestry, age, handicap or disability, sexual orientation, military discharge status, marital status, parental status or source of income and are treated in a non-discriminatory manner with regard to all job-related matters, including without limitation: employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training, including apprenticeship. Each Employer agrees to post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for employment, notices to be provided by the City setting forth the provisions of this nondiscrimination clause. In addition, the Employers, in all solicitations or advertisements for employees, shall state that all qualified applicants shall receive consideration for employment without discrimination based upon race, religion, color, sex, national origin or ancestry, age, handicap or disability, sexual orientation, military discharge status, marital status, parental status or source of income.
(b) To the greatest extent feasible, each Employer is required to present opportunities for training and employment of low- and moderate-income residents of the City and preferably of the Area; and to provide that contracts for work in connection with the construction of the Project be awarded to business concerns that are located in, or owned in substantial part by persons residing in, the City and preferably in the Area.

(c) Each Employer shall comply with all federal, state, and local equal employment and affirmative action statutes, rules, and regulations, including but not limited to the City's Human Rights Ordinance and the Illinois Human Rights Act, 775 ILCS 5/1-101, et seq. (1993), and any subsequent amendments and regulations promulgated thereto.

(d) Each Employer, in order to demonstrate compliance with the terms of this paragraph, shall cooperate with and promptly and accurately respond to inquiries by the City, which has the responsibility to observe and report compliance with equal employment opportunity regulations of federal, state and municipal agencies.

(e) Each Employer shall include the foregoing provisions of subparagraphs (a) through (d) in every contract entered into in connection with the Project, and shall require inclusion of these provisions in every subcontract entered into by any subcontractors, and every agreement with any Affiliate operating on the Property, so that each such provision shall be binding upon each contractor, subcontractor or Affiliate, as the case may be.

(f) Failure to comply with the employment obligations described in this paragraph shall be a basis for the City to pursue its remedies under the Redevelopment Agreement.

2. Prevailing Wage. The Developer, the General Contractor and all subcontractors must pay the prevailing wage rate as ascertained by the Illinois Department of Labor (the "Department"), to all persons working on the Project. All such contracts shall list the specified rates to be paid to all laborers, workers and mechanics for each craft or type of worker or mechanic employed pursuant to such contract. If the Department revises such prevailing wage rates, the revised rates shall apply to all such contracts. Upon the City's request, the Developer shall provide the City with copies of all such contracts entered into by the Developer or the General Contractor to evidence compliance with this Prevailing Wage.

3. City Resident Construction Worker Employment Requirement. The Developer agrees for itself and its successors and assigns, and shall contractually obligate its General Contractor and shall cause the General Contractor to contractually obligate its subcontractors, as applicable, to agree, that during the construction of the Project they shall comply with the minimum percentage of total worker hours performed by actual residents of the City as specified in Section 2-92-330 of the Municipal Code of Chicago (at least 50 percent of the total worker hours worked by persons on the site of the Project shall be performed by actual residents of the City); provided, however, that in addition to complying with this percentage, the Developer, its General Contractor and each subcontractor shall be required to make good faith efforts to utilize qualified residents of the City in both unskilled and skilled labor positions.
The Developer may request a reduction or waiver of this minimum percentage level of Chicagoans as provided for in Section 2-92-330 of the Municipal Code of Chicago in accordance with standards and procedures developed by the Chief Procurement Officer of the City.

"Actual residents of the City" shall mean persons domiciled within the City. The domicile is an individual's one and only true, fixed, and permanent home and principal establishment.

The Developer, the General Contractor and each subcontractor shall provide for the maintenance of adequate employee residency records to show that actual Chicago residents are employed on the Project. Each Employer shall maintain copies of personal documents supportive of every Chicago employee's actual record of residence.

Weekly certified payroll reports (U.S. Department of Labor Form WH-347 or equivalent) shall be submitted to the Commissioner of DPD in triplicate, which shall identify clearly the actual residence of every employee on each submitted certified payroll. The first time that an employee's name appears on a payroll, the date that the Employer hired the employee should be written in after the employee's name.

The Developer, the General Contractor and each subcontractor shall provide full access to their employment records to the Chief Procurement Officer, the Commissioner of DPD, the Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department, the Inspector General or any duly authorized representative of any of them. The Developer, the General Contractor and each subcontractor shall maintain all relevant personnel data and records for a period of at least three (3) years after final acceptance of the work constituting the Project.

At the direction of DPD, affidavits and other supporting documentation will be required of the Developer, the General Contractor, and each subcontractor to verify or clarify an employee's actual address when doubt or lack of clarity has arisen.

Good faith efforts on the part of the Developer, the General Contractor, and each subcontractor to provide utilization of actual Chicago residents (but not sufficient for the granting of a waiver request as provided for in the standards and procedures developed by the Chief Procurement Officer) shall not suffice to replace the actual, verified achievement of the requirements of this paragraph concerning the worker hours performed by actual Chicago residents.

When work at the Project is completed, in the event that the City has determined that the Developer has failed to ensure the fulfillment of the requirement of this paragraph concerning the worker hours performed by actual Chicago residents or failed to report in the manner as indicated above, the City will thereby be damaged in the failure to provide the benefit of demonstrable employment to Chicagoans to the degree stipulated in this paragraph. Therefore, in such a case of noncompliance, it is agreed that 1/20 of 1 percent (0.0005) of the aggregate hard construction costs set forth in the Project budget (the product of .0005 x such aggregate hard construction costs) (as the same shall be evidenced
by approved contract value for the actual contracts) shall be surrendered by the Developer to the City in payment for each percentage of shortfall toward the stipulated residency requirement. Failure to report the residency of employees entirely and correctly shall result in the surrender of the entire liquidated damages as if no Chicago residents were employed in either of the categories. The willful falsification of statements and the certification of payroll data may subject the Developer, the General Contractor and/or the subcontractors to prosecution. Any retainage to cover contract performance that may become due to the Developer pursuant to Section 2-92-250 of the Municipal Code of Chicago may be withheld by the City pending the Chief Procurement Officer's determination as to whether the Developer must surrender damages as provided in this paragraph.

Nothing herein provided shall be construed to be a limitation upon the "Notice of Requirements for Affirmative Action to Ensure Equal Employment Opportunity, Executive Order 11246" and "Standard Federal Equal Employment Opportunity, Executive Order 11246", or other affirmative action required for equal opportunity under the provisions of this Agreement or related documents.

The Developer shall cause or require the provisions of this paragraph to be included in all construction contracts and subcontracts related to the Project.

4. MBE/WBE Commitment. The Developer agrees for itself and its successors and assigns, and, if necessary to meet the requirements set forth herein, shall contractually obligate the General Contractor to agree that, during the Project:

(a) Consistent with the findings which support the Minority-Owned and Women-Owned Business Enterprise Procurement Program (the "MBE/WBE Program"), Section 2-92-420, et seq., Municipal Code of Chicago, and in reliance upon the provisions of the MBE/WBE Program to the extent contained in, and as qualified by, the provisions of this paragraph 4, during the course of the Project, at least the following percentages of the MBE/WBE Budget attached hereto as (Sub)Exhibit B (as these budgeted amounts may be reduced to reflect decreased actual costs) shall be expended for contract participation by MBEs or WBEs:

i. At least 26 percent by MBEs; and

ii. At least 6 percent by WBEs.

(b) For purposes of MBE/WBE Commitment only, the Developer (and any party to whom a contract is let by the Developer in connection with the Project) shall be deemed a "contractor" and this Agreement (and any contract let by the Developer in connection with the Project) shall be deemed a "contract" as such terms are defined in Section 2-92-420, Municipal Code of Chicago.
(c) Consistent with Section 2-92-440, Municipal Code of Chicago, the Developer's MBE/WBE Commitment may be achieved in part by the Developer's status as an MBE or WBE (but only to the extent of any actual work performed on the Project by the Developer), or by a joint venture with one or more MBEs or WBEs (but only to the extent of the lesser of: (i) the MBE or WBE participation in such joint venture; or (ii) the amount of any actual work performed on the Project by the MBE or WBE), by the Developer utilizing an MBE or a WBE as a General Contractor (but only to the extent of any actual work performed on the Project by the General Contractor), by subcontracting or causing the General Contractor to subcontract a portion of the Project to one or more MBEs or WBEs, or by the purchase of materials used in the Project from one or more MBEs or WBEs, or by any combination of the foregoing. Those entities which constitute both an MBE and a WBE shall not be credited more than once with regard to the Developer's MBE/WBE Commitment as described in this paragraph 4. The Developer or the General Contractor may meet all or part of this commitment through credits received pursuant to Section 2-92-530 of the Municipal Code of Chicago for the voluntary use of MBEs or WBEs in its activities and operations other than the Project.

(d) Prior to the City's issuance of a Final Certificate, the Developer shall provide to DPD a final report describing its efforts to achieve compliance with this MBE/WBE Commitment. Such report shall include inter alia the name and business address of each MBE and WBE solicited by the Developer or the General Contractor to work on the Project, and the responses received from such solicitation, the name and business address of each MBE or WBE actually involved in the Project, a description of the work performed or products or services supplied, the date and amount of such work, product or service, and such other information as may assist DPD in determining the Developer's compliance with this MBE/WBE Commitment. DPD has access to the Developer's books and records, including, without limitation, payroll records, books of account and tax returns, and records and books of account in accordance with the Redevelopment Agreement, on five (5) business days' notice, to allow the City to review the Developer's compliance with its commitment to MBE/WBE participation and the status of any MBE or WBE performing any portion of the Project.

(e) Upon the disqualification of any MBE or WBE General Contractor or subcontractor, if such status was misrepresented by the disqualified party, the Developer shall be obligated to discharge or cause to be discharged the disqualified General Contractor or subcontractor and, if possible, identify and engage a qualified MBE or WBE as a replacement. For purposes of this subsection (e), the disqualification procedures are further described in Section 2-92-540, Municipal Code of Chicago.

(f) Any reduction or waiver of the Developer's MBE/WBE Commitment as described in this paragraph 4 shall be undertaken in accordance with Section 2-92-450, Municipal Code of Chicago.
(g) Prior to the commencement of the Project, the Developer, the General Contractor, and all major subcontractors shall be required to meet with the monitoring staff of DPD with regard to the Developer's compliance with its obligations under this Agreement. During this meeting, the Developer shall demonstrate to DPD its plan to achieve its obligations under this Agreement, the sufficiency of which shall be approved by DPD. During the Project, the Developer shall, upon the request of the monitoring staff of DPD, such interim reports as the monitoring staff may require. Failure to submit such documentation on a timely basis, or a determination by DPD, upon analysis of the documentation, that the Developer is not complying with its obligations hereunder shall, upon the delivery of written notice to the Developer, be deemed an Event of Default hereunder.

CHICAGO, January 8, 2025.

To the President and Members of the City Council:

Your Committee on Housing and Real Estate, for which a meeting was held on January 7, 2025 and to which was referred a substitute ordinance from the Department of Planning and Development for the acceptance of bid from Latonya Nelson for vacant City-owned parcel at 148 South Hamlin Boulevard and from Deborah Turner for vacant City-owned parcel at 718 -- 722 West 60th Place under ChiBlockBuilder platform for community open space designation (16th and 28th Wards) (SO2024-0013768), having had the same under advisement, begs leave to report and recommend that Your Honorable Body Pass the said proposed substitute ordinance transmitted herewith.

Alderperson Mitchell moved to reconsider the foregoing vote. The motion was lost.

The following is said ordinance as passed:

WHEREAS, The City of Chicago ("City") is a home rule unit of government by virtue of the provisions of the Constitution of the State of Illinois of 1970 and, as such, may exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and

WHEREAS, The City, through the foreclosure of demolition liens, tax sales and other methods of acquisition, has acquired title to thousands of parcels of vacant land which are costly to clean up and maintain, do not generate property taxes, and are a detriment to the community; and

WHEREAS, The City has traditionally sold much of its land directly to purchasers after receiving property inquiries, a method which is inefficient, labor-intensive and also lacks transparency; and

WHEREAS, In an effort to attract and reach potential buyers and create a more competitive process, the Department of Planning and Development (the "Department") created chiblockbuilder.com ("ChiBlockBuilder"), a website-based platform for selling vacant City-owned property with predetermined purchase prices and online application materials; and

WHEREAS, City lots sold through ChiBlockBuilder are offered for sale in different categories of use, such as affordable housing, market rate sales, missing middle-density housing, neighborhood side yards, community open space and urban agriculture; and

WHEREAS, ChiBlockBuilder allows prospective buyers to view a map of available properties and their associated land use categories online, and apply to purchase lots for targeted purposes; and
WHEREAS, The Department retained the services of CBRE Group, Inc. to provide market value assessments of the available City-owned properties based on comparable sales, and these market value assessments are posted on the ChiBlockBuilder website to establish purchase prices for all properties marketed for sale; and

WHEREAS, The Department offered the properties identified on Exhibit A attached hereto (the "City Lots") for sale on the ChiBlockBuilder website for community open space, with the goal of attracting residents, nonprofit organizations and businesses to fence and manage vacant property for local neighborhood activities; and

WHEREAS, The Department accepted applications for the City Lots beginning on April 1, 2024 and ending on May 16, 2024 (the "Application Period"); and

WHEREAS, A public notice directing prospective applicants to ChiBlockBuilder for listings of City-owned properties for sale during the Application Period was published in the Chicago Tribune on April 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29, 2024 and May 6 and 13, 2024; and

WHEREAS, Eligible buyers of the City Lots had to meet the following qualifications: (1) be residents, nonprofit organizations or next-door business owners; (2) submit a site plan, budget and program for the project; (3) show support from the nearby community for the project; (4) be able to maintain and care for the lot; (5) be able to pay property taxes on the land; and (6) complete projects within one year from closing; and

WHEREAS, The Department evaluated the applications from eligible open space buyers based on the following criteria: the detail and quality of the project description and site plan, the project budget, the impact on next door neighbors and the surrounding community, and proof of support for the project from neighbors, such as letters of support, presentations at community meetings, or consistency with neighborhood plans; and

WHEREAS, The Department selected the buyers for the City lots identified on Exhibit A (each, a "Buyer") for the projects described on Exhibit A; and

WHEREAS, The names of all applicants for each City Lot, the names of the finalists, and a summary of the finalist proposals are set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto; and

WHEREAS, The Department desires to convey each City Lot to the respective Buyer subject to a deed restriction requiring the Buyer to improve the City Lot with an open space project and own the property for a minimum period of five years after closing; and

WHEREAS, The Buyers have agreed to purchase the City Lots for the purchase prices listed on Exhibit A (each, a "Purchase Price"), which represent 10 percent of the market value assessment for the applicable City Lots; now, therefore,

Be It Ordained by the City Council of the City of Chicago:

SECTION 1. The foregoing recitals, findings and statements of fact are incorporated herein and made a material part of this ordinance.
SECTION 2. The City Council hereby approves the sale of each City Lot in its "as is" condition to the Buyers identified on Exhibit A for the Purchase Prices listed on Exhibit A.

SECTION 3. The Mayor or the Mayor's proxy is authorized to execute, and the City Clerk or the Deputy City Clerk is authorized to attest, quitclaim deeds (each, a "Deed") conveying the City Lots to the respective Buyers, or to a land trust of which the Buyer is the sole beneficiary, or to an entity of which the Buyer is the sole controlling party or which is comprised of the same principal parties. Without limiting the quitclaim nature of each Deed, the conveyance of each City Lot shall be subject to the following: the standard exceptions in an ALTA title insurance policy; general real estate taxes and any special assessments or other taxes; easements, encroachments, covenants, restrictions and liens of record and not shown of record; such other title defects as may exist; and any and all exceptions caused by the acts of the Buyer or the Buyer's agents. In addition, the Deed shall include the following terms, covenants and conditions, in substantially the form set forth below, which are a part of the consideration for each City Lot and which shall run with the land and be binding upon and enforceable against the Buyer and the Buyer's heirs, successors and assigns, in perpetuity (unless a shorter period is expressly stated below):

1. Covenant To Improve City Lot With Open Space Project; Restriction On Conveyance. Buyer shall: (a) improve the City Lot with the open space project described in Buyer's ChiBlockBuilder application and approved by the City's Department of Planning and Development within one (1) year from the date of this Deed; (b) maintain the City Lot in accordance with the provisions of the Municipal Code of Chicago; and (c) not convey, assign or otherwise transfer the City Lot.

If any of these conditions are not met, the City may record a notice of default against the City Lot and shall have the right to exercise any and all remedies available to it at law or in equity, including the right to re-enter the City Lot and revest title in the City. Buyer, at the request of the City, covenants to execute and deliver to the City a reconveyance deed to the City Lot to further evidence of such revesting of title. This right of reverter in favor of the City shall terminate five (5) years following the date of this Deed.

2. Environmental Documents Review. The City, acting through its Bureau of Environmental, Health and Safety Management in the Department of Assets, Information and Services ("Bureau"), has conducted a limited review ("Limited Review") of certain City records and other information ("Review Documents") in an effort to identify potential environmental concerns associated with the City Lot. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer has previously received a summary of the Bureau's Limited Review, and that the City has made all Review Documents available to Buyer for inspection and copying upon request.

3. Limited Nature Of City's Limited Review. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the City does not represent or warrant that the Bureau's methodology for or findings from its Limited Review are accurate or complete or that the environmental condition of or risks to the City Lot are consistent with the Bureau's summary of its Limited Review. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that the City did not perform a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment or conduct a thorough environmental investigation of the City Lot, and that the City's review of the Review Documents was limited. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Bureau's Limited Review may not have located all City, publicly available, or other documents or information relating to the condition of the City Lot, and that there may be other conditions, uses, and sources or types of contamination affecting the City Lot. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the City is not obligated to locate all such documentation or information or to perform any environmental investigation or evaluation of the City Lot.

4. Historic Contamination Of Urban Land. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that properties in urban areas, including Chicago, are frequently impacted by historical conditions and uses that may not be documented in the Review Documents, such as: a) buried demolition debris containing lead-based paint or asbestos; (b) underground heating oil tanks; (c) off-site migration of chemicals from existing or former gas stations, dry cleaners, metal finishing operations, lumber treatment facilities, and other commercial, industrial or manufacturing land uses; (d) illegal dumping; (e) nearby railroad operations; and (f) airborne deposit of lead and other contaminants from historical use of lead gasoline and surrounding industries. Buyer acknowledges receipt of a fact sheet prepared by the United States Environmental Protection Agency about urban gardening best management practices to prevent or reduce exposure to contaminants that may be present in soils, "Reusing Potentially Contaminated Landscapes: Growing Gardens in Urban Soils", EPA 542/F-10/011 (Spring 2011).

5. "As Is", "Where Is" And "With All Faults" Conveyance. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer has had an opportunity to inspect the City Lot and is relying solely upon Buyer's own inspection and other due diligence activities that Buyer may have conducted in determining whether to acquire the City Lot, and not upon any information provided by or on behalf of the City with respect thereto, including without limitation, the Limited Review, the Review Documents and any summary thereof. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the City Lot is being conveyed, and Buyer accepts the City Lot, in its "As Is", "Where Is" and "With All Faults" condition without any covenant, representation, or warranty, express or implied, of any kind, regarding the physical or environmental condition of the City Lot or the suitability of the City Lot for any purpose whatsoever. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer is solely responsible for any investigation and remediation work necessary to put the City Lot in a condition which is suitable for its intended use.

6. Release Of City.

WHEREAS, The City, through the foreclosure of demolition liens, tax sales and other methods of acquisition, has acquired title to thousands of parcels of vacant land which are costly to clean up and maintain, do not generate property taxes, and are a detriment to the community; and

WHEREAS, The City has traditionally sold much of its land directly to purchasers after receiving property inquiries, a method which is inefficient, labor-intensive and also lacks transparency; and

WHEREAS, In an effort to attract and reach potential buyers and create a more competitive process, the Department of Planning and Development (the "Department") created chiblockbuilder.com ("ChiBlockBuilder"), a website-based platform for selling vacant City-owned property with predetermined purchase prices and online application materials; and

WHEREAS, City lots sold through ChiBlockBuilder are offered for sale in different categories of use, such as affordable housing, market rate sales, missing middle-density housing, neighborhood side yards, community open space and urban agriculture; and

WHEREAS, ChiBlockBuilder allows prospective buyers to view a map of available properties and their associated land use categories online, and apply to purchase lots for targeted purposes; and

WHEREAS, The Department retained the services of CBRE Group, Inc. to provide market value assessments of the available City-owned properties based on comparable sales, and these market value assessments are posted on the ChiBlockBuilder website to establish purchase prices for all properties marketed for sale; and

WHEREAS, The Department offered the properties identified on Exhibit A attached hereto (the "City Lots") for sale on the ChiBlockBuilder website for community open space, with the goal of attracting residents, nonprofit organizations and businesses to fence and manage vacant property for local neighborhood activities; and

WHEREAS, The Department accepted applications for the City Lots beginning on May 17, 2024 and ending on July 1, 2024 (the "Application Period"); and

WHEREAS, A public notice directing prospective applicants to ChiBlockBuilder for listings of City-owned properties for sale during the Application Period was published in the Chicago Tribune on April 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29, 2024, May 6, 13, 20 and 27, 2024 and June 3, 10, 17 and 24, 2024; and
WHEREAS, Eligible buyers of the City Lots had to meet the following qualifications: (1) be residents, nonprofit organizations or next-door business owners; (2) submit a site plan, budget and program for the project; (3) show support from the nearby community for the project; (4) be able to maintain and care for the lot; (5) be able to pay property taxes on the land; and (6) complete projects within one year from closing; and

WHEREAS, The Department evaluated the applications from eligible open space buyers based on the following criteria: the detail and quality of the project description and site plan, the project budget, the impact on next door neighbors and the surrounding community, and proof of support for the project from neighbors, such as letters of support, presentations at community meetings, or consistency with neighborhood plans; and

WHEREAS, The Department selected the buyers for the City Lots identified on Exhibit A (each, a “Buyer”) for the projects described on Exhibit A; and

WHEREAS, The names of all applicants for each City Lot, the names of the finalists, and a summary of the finalist proposals are set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto; and

WHEREAS, The Department desires to convey each City Lot to the respective Buyer subject to a deed restriction requiring the Buyer to improve the City Lot with an open space project and own the property for a minimum period of five years after closing; and

WHEREAS, The Buyers have agreed to purchase the City Lots for the purchase prices listed on Exhibit A (each, a “Purchase Price”), which represent 10 percent of the market value assessment for the applicable City Lots; now, therefore,

Be It Ordained by the City Council of the City of Chicago:

SECTION 1. The foregoing recitals, findings and statements of fact are incorporated herein and made a material part of this ordinance.

Without limiting the quitclaim nature of each Deed, the conveyance of each City Lot shall be subject to the following: the standard exceptions in an ALTA title insurance policy; general real estate taxes and any special assessments or other taxes; easements, encroachments, covenants, restrictions and liens of record and not shown of record; such other title defects as may exist; and any and all exceptions caused by the acts of the Buyer or the Buyer’s agents.

5. "As Is", "Where Is" And "With All Faults" Conveyance. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer has had an opportunity to inspect the City Lot and is relying solely upon Buyer's own inspection and other due diligence activities that Buyer may have conducted in determining whether to acquire the City Lot, and not upon any information provided by or on behalf of the City with respect thereto, including without limitation, the Limited Review, the Review Documents and any summary thereof. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the City Lot is being conveyed, and Buyer accepts the City Lot, in its "As Is", "Where Is" and "With All Faults" condition without any covenant, representation, or warranty, express or implied, of any kind, regarding the physical or environmental condition of the City Lot or the suitability of the City Lot for any purpose whatsoever.

[SO2024-0014443]

The Committee on License and Consumer Protection submitted the following report:

CHICAGO, January 15, 2025.

To the President and Members of the City Council:

Your Committee on License and Consumer Protection, having under consideration a substitute ordinance introduced by Alderperson Marty Quinn and Alderperson Silvana Tabares (which was referred on December 13, 2024) to amend Chapter 4-4 of the Municipal Code of Chicago prohibiting the sale of cannabis hemp products and issuance of new or renewal of existing tobacco dealer licenses in the Midway Regional Area, begs leave to recommend that Your Honorable Body Pass the proposed substitute ordinance which is transmitted herewith.
This recommendation was concurred in by the members of the Committee on License and Consumer Protection on January 7, 2025.

Respectfully submitted,

(Signed) DEBRA SILVERSTEIN,
Chair.

On motion of Alderperson Silverstein, the said proposed substitute ordinance transmitted with the foregoing committee report was Passed by yeas and nays as follows:

Yeas -- Alderpersons La Spata, Hopkins, Dowell, Robinson, Yancy, Hall, Mitchell, Harris, Beale, Chico, Lee, Ramirez, Quinn, Gutierrez, Lopez, Coleman, Moore, Curtis, O'Shea, Taylor, Mosley, Rodriguez, Tabares, Scott, Sigcho-Lopez, Fuentes, Burnett, Ervin, Taliaferro, Cruz, Cardona, Waguespack, Rodriguez-Sanchez, Conway, Ramirez-Rosa, Villegas, Mitts, Sposato, Nugent, Vasquez, Napolitano, Reilly, Knudsen, Lawson, Gardiner, Clay, Martin, Manaa-Hoppenworth, Hadden, Silverstein -- 50.

Alderperson Mitchell moved to reconsider the foregoing vote. The motion was lost.

The following is said ordinance as passed:

WHEREAS, The City of Chicago (the “City”) is a home rule unit of government under Article VII, Section 6(a) of the Constitution of the State of Illinois and, as such, may exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs, including the power to regulate for the protection of the public health, safety, morals, and welfare; and

WHEREAS, While Chicago Midway International Airport is an international and domestic hub, it is predominantly surrounded by residential neighborhoods that are home to thousands of families, with John F. Kennedy High School and Gurdon S. Hubbard High School consistently ranking among the most overcrowded schools in the City; and

WHEREAS, Further, these residential neighborhoods are located within the 8th Police District, which serves over 250,000 residents -- the most of any police district -- with approximately 10 officers for every 10,000 residents -- more than double the Citywide average; and

WHEREAS, The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 -- commonly known as the 2018 Farm Bill -- legalized, but did not regulate, certain cannabinoid hemp products; and
WHEREAS, This lack of regulation has led to a proliferation of retailers selling essentially unregulated psychoactive cannabis, often containing significant quantities of delta-8 and delta-9 THC, with no safety regulations such as minimum age limits, testing, or truth in labeling requirements; and

WHEREAS, In order to protect the health and safety of our residents, the City Council desires to prohibit the sale of such unregulated cannabinoid hemp products in and around the residential neighborhoods surrounding Midway Airport; now, therefore,

Be It Ordained by the City Council of the City of Chicago:

SECTION 1. The foregoing recitals are hereby adopted as the findings of the City Council.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this Code, any person who violates any of the requirements of this section or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder shall be fined not less than $2,000.00 nor more than $5,000.00 for each offense. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate and distinct offense to which a separate fine shall apply.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Hazard mitigation is the use of long-term and short-term policies, programs, projects, and other activities to alleviate the death, injury, and property damage that can result from a disaster. Cook County and a coalition of 125 municipal planning partners prepared and updated the 2024 Cook County Multi-Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan (MJ-HMP) in order to identify the risks posed by hazards and find ways to reduce their impacts. The plan reduces risk for those who live in, work in, and visit the County.

Participating Partners and the Planning Area

The responsibility for hazard mitigation lies with many, including private property owners, business and industry, and local, state, and federal government. Through multi-jurisdictional partnerships, local jurisdictions within an area with uniform risk exposure can pool resources and eliminate redundant planning activities. Cook County opened this planning effort to all municipalities within the County. Table: Planning Partners lists the partners that participated in the planning process and are covered under this plan. The planning area was defined as all incorporated and unincorporated areas of Cook County and the incorporated areas of cities that cross county boundaries. The planning area boundary is shown in the figure below (Figure: Planning Area).
The jurisdictions not participating in the 2024 MJ-HMP are border jurisdictions and are part of other county mitigation plans.

### Plan Development and Organization

The 2024 Cook County MJ-HMP was updated by a planning team of Cook County Department of Emergency Management and Regional Security staff and expert consultants, with guidance from a steering committee representing the planning partners and other local stakeholders. The key steps in updating the plan were as follows:

1. Determine the Planning Area and Resources
2. Build and Reconvene the Planning Team
3. Outreach Strategy
4. Review and Update Community Capabilities
5. Update and Conduct the Risk Assessment
6. Update the Mitigation Strategy
7. Keep the Plan Current
8. Review and Adopt the Plan
9. Create a Safe and Resilient Community

The final plan consists of two volumes. Volume 1 includes all federally required elements of a disaster mitigation plan that apply to the entire planning area. Volume 2 consists of all federally required jurisdiction-specific elements in individual annexes for each participating jurisdiction.

Mission Goals and Objectives

The defined mission for the 2024 Cook County MJ-HMP is to "Identify risks and sustainable, cost-effective actions to mitigate the impact of natural hazards to protect the life, health, safety, welfare, and economy of the communities of Cook County." Mitigation goals were established as follows:

1. Develop and implement sustainable, cost-effective, and environmentally sound risk-reduction (mitigation) projects.
2. Protect the lives, health, safety, and property of Cook County residents from natural hazards.
3. Protect public services and critical facilities, including infrastructure, from loss of use during natural hazard events and potential damage from such activities.
4. Involve stakeholders to enhance the local capacity to mitigate, prepare for, and respond to the impacts of natural hazards.
5. Develop, promote, and integrate mitigation action plans.
6. Promote public understanding of and support for hazard mitigation.

Thirteen objectives were established for the plan to meet multiple goals and serve as stand-alone measurements of the effectiveness of the mitigation action. Proposed mitigation actions were evaluated in part based on how many goals and objectives they would help to fulfill.

1. Eliminate or minimize disruption of local government operations caused by natural hazards through all phases of emergency management.
2. Increase the resilience of (or protect and maintain) infrastructure and critical facilities.
3. Consider the impacts of natural hazards on future land uses in the planning area, including possible impacts from climate change.
4. Integrate hazard mitigation policies into land use plans in the planning area.
5. Develop, improve, and protect systems that provide early warnings, emergency response communications, and evacuation procedures.
6. Use the best available data, science and technologies to educate the public and to improve understanding of the location and potential impacts of natural hazards, the vulnerability of building types and community development patterns, and the measures needed to protect life safety.
7. Retrofit, purchase, or relocate structures in high-hazard areas, including those known to be repetitively damaged.
8. Establish partnerships among all levels of local government, the private sector, and/or nongovernmental organizations to improve and implement methods to protect people, including underserved and underrepresented groups, and property.
9. Provide or improve flood protection on a watershed basis with flood control structures and drainage maintenance plans.
10. Strengthen codes and land use planning and their enforcement so that new construction or redevelopment can avoid or withstand the impacts of natural hazards.
11. Encourage mitigation through incentive-based programs like the Community Rating System and StormReady programs.

12. Reduce natural hazard-related risks and vulnerability to potentially isolated and underserved populations within the planning area and ensure mitigation strategies result in equitable outcomes.

13. Encourage hazard mitigation measures that have the least adverse effect on the natural environment and use natural processes.

Detailed risk assessments were performed for each of these hazards of concern. Also, a brief qualitative review was conducted of technological and human-caused hazards of interest. Climate Change was addressed for each hazard, as applicable.

Risk Assessment Methodology

The risk assessments of the identified hazards of concern describe the risks associated with each hazard. The following steps were used to define the risk of each hazard:

- Profile and update each hazard, describing the geographic area it affects, its frequency and severity, and the warning time provided before a hazard event occurs.
- Use maps of hazard impact areas, as appropriate, to determine and update the number of structures, facilities, and systems exposed to each hazard.
- Assess the vulnerability of exposed structures and infrastructure based on exposure and the probability of occurrence of a hazard event. Tools such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) hazard-modeling program HAZUS-MH were used to perform an assessment for flood and earthquake.

Jurisdiction Profile

The following is a summary of key information about the jurisdiction and its history:

Date of Incorporation: 1837

Current Population: The 2020 U.S. Census population was 2,746,352. The 2022 U.S. Census estimate indicated the population was 2,665,039.

Population Growth: The overall population has decreased 1.51% percent between 2018 and 2022.

Location and Description: The City of Chicago is located in northeastern Illinois at 41°59 N and 86°54 W, and at an altitude of 578.5 feet above sea level. It is the third-most populous city in the United States and is the county seat of Cook County. Chicago has often been called a global architecture capital and is considered one of the most important business centers in the world. Positioned along Lake Michigan, the City is an international hub for finance, commerce, industry, technology, telecommunications, and transportation. O'Hare International Airport is the second-busiest airport in the world when measured by aircraft traffic; the region also has the largest number of U.S. highways and railroad freight. In 2012, Chicago was listed as an alpha global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, and ranked seventh in the world in the 2016 Global Cities Index. Chicago has the third-largest gross metropolitan product in the United States—about $640 billion according to 2015 estimates. The City has one of the world's largest and most diversified economies, with no single industry employing more than 14% of the workforce.

Brief History: Chicago's recorded history begins with the arrival of French explorers, missionaries and fur traders in the late 17th century and their interaction with the local Potawatomi Native Americans. The modern city was incorporated in 1837 by Northern businessmen and grew rapidly from real estate speculation and the realization that it had a commanding position in the emerging inland transportation network, based on lake traffic and railroads, controlling access from the Great Lakes into the Mississippi River basin. Despite the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, the city grew exponentially, becoming the nation's rail center and the dominant Midwestern center for
manufacturing, commerce, finance, higher education, religion, broadcasting, sports, jazz, and high culture. Chicago is now a highly urbanized area and much of its natural environment has been altered since its early development.

**Climate:** The climate of Chicago is classified as humid continental, with all four seasons distinctly represented: wet springs; variably hot, humid summers; pleasantly mild autumns; and cold winters. Temperatures are at the lowest in the months of January and February, and the highest during the months of July and August. Chicago's weather has the presence of Lake Michigan which influences the weather throughout the year. The highest official temperature ever recorded in Chicago was 105°F on July 24, 1934. The coldest official temperature ever recorded was -27°F on January 20, 1985. The yearly precipitation average is 36.89 inches. Chicago is prone to thunderstorms from spring to early fall. Heavy rainfall events can occur with thunderstorms and occasional prolonged systems. The average Chicago winter season produces 36.7 inches of snow, but these tend to vary.

**Governing Body Format:** Chicago City government is divided into executive and legislative branches. The mayor is the chief executive while the City Council, elected from 50 wards, is the legislative body. Government priorities and activities are established in a budget ordinance usually adopted in November of each year. The City takes official action through the passage of ordinances and resolutions. In addition to the Mayor, Chicago's two other city-wide elected officials are the City Clerk and the City Treasurer. The Chicago Police Department provides law enforcement and the Chicago Fire Department provides fire suppression and emergency medical services for the City and its residents. Civil and criminal law cases are heard in the Cook County Circuit Court of the State of Illinois court system, or in the Northern District of Illinois, in the federal system. In the state court, the public prosecutor is the Illinois State's Attorney; and, in the Federal court, it is the United States Attorney.

**Population and Development Trends:** Chicago is a heavily urbanized city, with only 7.1% of its total land area classified as open space. The City has seen a large increase in its Central Business District (CBD) population over the last 20 years. The CBD and adjacent neighborhoods are currently undergoing a building boom, with over $20 billion in "megaprojects" currently underway or in the planning stages. The Chicago Sustainable Development Policy has been continuously implemented since 2004. The goal of the policy is to enhance the sustainable performance of projects receiving City assistance. It requires development projects that are receiving financial assistance or special approvals from the City to include sustainable elements. The Policy has been a driving force in making Chicago a global leader in the green roof movement as well as the number of LEED certified projects. As of 2013, the City of Chicago had more than 500 green roofs totaling nearly 5.6 million square feet. More than 500 development projects have been LEED certified, which equates to roughly 180 million square feet. The City and its surrounding metropolitan area contain the third-largest labor pool in the United States with about 4.63 million workers. Illinois is home to 66 Fortune 1000 companies, including those in Chicago. The City of Chicago also hosts 12 Fortune Global 500 companies and 17 Financial Times 500 companies. The City claims three Dow 30 companies: aerospace giant, Boeing, which moved its headquarters from Seattle to the Chicago Loop in 2001, McDonald's, and Kraft Heinz. According to Site Selection magazine, the Chicago area has seen the most corporate headquarters relocation or expansion projects in the U.S. for each of four consecutive years from 2013 to 2016.

Future major assets include;

- Underserved communities continue to be more vulnerable to flooding
Changes in Community Priorities: There have been no significant changes in priority regarding the hazards that could potentially impact the community or changes in priority regarding resilience.

**NFIP Participation Activities**

Maintaining compliance under the NFIP is an important component of flood risk reduction. All planning partners that participate in the NFIP have identified actions to maintain their compliance and good standing. Cook County entered the NFIP on April 15, 1981. Structures permitted or built in the County before then are called "pre-FIRM" structures, and structures built afterwards are called "post-FIRM." The insurance rate is different for the two types of structures. The effective date for the current countywide FIRM is August 19, 2008. This map is a DFIRM (digital flood insurance rate map). The communities in Cook County that participate in the NFIP are shown in Table: NFIP Participating Communities in Cook County in Volume I of the Cook County MJ-HMP.
The NFIP makes federally-backed flood insurance available to homeowners, renters, and business owners in participating communities. The communities in Cook County that participate in the NFIP and their "Policies in Force," "Total Coverage," and "Total Written Premiums" are shown in Table: Cook County Flood Insurance Policies in Volume I of the Cook County MJ-HMP.

**Substantial Improvement Rule and the Substantial Damage Rule**

The IDNR/OWR has developed a model ordinance for floodplain management, which has been adopted by most communities in Illinois. The ordinance includes the minimum requirements an NFIP participating jurisdiction must adopt and enforce, as well as additional higher regulatory requirements. The optional, higher regulatory standards include a minimum one foot of freeboard above the base flood elevation and cumulative tracking of damage repairs and improvements to establish substantial damage and substantial improvement compliance. Some jurisdictions have chosen to exceed the requirements of the model ordinance and have adopted more restrictive ordinances. This is most common in the communities in northeastern Illinois.

**Existing Municipal Code:**

14B2-202 Definitions

"SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. As defined in Chapter 2 of the Chicago Building Rehabilitation Code."

"SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. As defined in Chapter 2 of the Chicago Building Rehabilitation Code."

16-6-071 Means of Protection in Zone VE

Buildings located in Zone VE that are subject to Section 16-6-060 must meet the protection requirements described in this section.

(a) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated on pilings or columns so that the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to or above the F.P.E., and the pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components.

(c) All new construction and substantial improvements shall have the space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with non-supporting breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work, or insect screening intended to collapse without causing collapse, displacement, or other structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system.

16-6-120 General Considerations

The City of Chicago shall take into account flood hazards, to the extent that they are known, in all official actions related to land management, use and development.

Opportunities to Expand and Improve Capabilities

Opportunities to expand and improve capabilities include developing a strategy to identify and set aside municipal funds to assist with the 25% cost match for FEMA HMA mitigation grants. Due to the technical expertise needed to develop grant applications and benefit cost analyses for FEMA HMA grants, the municipality has a need for qualified grant writers to assist in the development and management of these grants.

Plan Integration

The capability assessment describes opportunities to "link" or integrate the mitigation plan into other planning mechanisms. The process and mechanism to identify opportunities to integrate the Cook County MJ-HMP into other planning mechanisms will occur during the Annual Update Process and be reflected in the Jurisdictional Annual Report each year. Specific plan integration opportunities will include:

- The hazards, goals, and actions of the Hazard Mitigation Plan will be considered in the next update of the Comprehensive Plan.

Emergency Plan Integration:

Cook County EMRS is supporting communities to develop and update their respective Emergency Operations Plans, Continuity of Operations Plan/Continuity of Government Plan, and Recovery Plan in 2024. This is an ongoing countywide initiative and is being implemented in all municipalities.

Emergency Operations Plan (EOP)

An EOP template was created for all municipalities. The 2019 Cook County MJ-HMP and the hazards in the mitigation plan have been integrated into the Situation and Assumptions section of the EOP. Within that section, the natural hazards based on the 2019 MJ-HMP were added in the Initial Analysis and Assessment and Identification of Hazards section of the EOP. The hazards in the 2019 plan and the 2024 MJ-HMP did not change apart from adding wildfires for the Forest Preserve and unincorporated areas of the County. Future updates of the EOP will take into consideration any additional new natural hazards that are added to subsequent updates to the MJ-HMP.

Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP)

The Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) for the municipality includes a Situation section that is based on the 2019 Cook County MJ-HMP jurisdictional annex, and specifically the hazards identified in the annex. The COOP-specific risk assessment is hazard-specific and based on likelihood of occurrence and severity of impact.

Recovery Plan

The goals of the Recovery Plan were developed to align with the 2019 Cook County MJ-HMP, and specifically prioritizes the responsibility of officials under this plan to save lives, protect property, relieve human suffering, sustain survivors, repair essential facilities, restore services, and protect the environment. The plan acknowledges that hazard mitigation is an important priority and consideration during the rebuilding process.
Jurisdiction-Specific Natural Hazard Event History

The information provided below was solicited from the jurisdiction and supported by NOAA and other relevant data sources.

The Natural Hazard Events Table lists all past occurrences of natural hazards within the jurisdiction. Repetitive flood loss records are as follows:

- Number of FEMA-Identified Repetitive Loss Properties: 70 (45 Single Family, 10 Two-Four Family Residence, 14 Other Residential, 1 Other-Nonresidential)
- Number of FEMA-Identified Severe Repetitive Loss Properties: 0
- Number of Repetitive Flood Loss/Severe Repetitive Loss Properties That Have Been Mitigated: 1

- Thunderstorms moved across northern Illinois during the late morning and early afternoon of August 29th, producing swaths of significant wind damage. Scattered thunderstorms developed across east central Illinois during the late afternoon and evening.
• A supercell thunderstorm moved across portions of central Cook County and the north side of Chicago, producing a narrow swath of torrential rainfall of 4 to 6 inches. Flash flooding developed across many areas, with streets quickly becoming flooded and numerous stranded vehicles in the flood waters. A car was stuck in flood waters in the 4800 block of Ravenswood Avenue, where a woman and two children were rescued. Significant flooding occurred along Foster, Lawrence, and Bryn Mawr Avenues, where cars were stalled in flood waters and some drivers needed to be rescued. A car was stuck in a flooded viaduct at 1800 Foster Avenue. A car was stuck in a flooded viaduct at Foster Avenue and Lake Shore Drive. A car was stuck in flood waters in the 2700 block of Diversey Avenue. Numerous residential streets were flooded with 1 to 2 feet of standing water. A nursing home was flooded along Western Avenue. An estimated 2,000 basements suffered some amount of flooding. Water was seen shooting up from various sewers, which was likely due to pressure differences in the vast sewer system and the localized nature of the heaviest rain. The highest rainfall totals included 5.90 inches in Lincoln Square, where about 4 inches fell in 75 minutes ending at 8:55 am CST; 5.86 inches in Portage Park, where about 3.4 inches fell in one hour ending at 8:30 am CST; and 5.63 inches in Albany Park where about 3.5 inches fell in one hour ending at 8:40 am CST.

Damage amounts were unknown for the remaining affected homes as well as vehicles that were affected by flooding.

2023

• A winter storm brought impactful snow and freezing rain to parts of northern Illinois. Rain and snow began moving into the area during the predawn hours of the 28th and continued into the overnight with the heaviest snow falling during the afternoon and evening. O'Hare Airport measured 2.3 inches of snow and 0.04 inches of ice accumulation. Up to a tenth of an inch of ice accumulation across portions of the Chicago metropolitan area.

• Snow developed across far northern Illinois during the morning of February 16th and continued into the late evening. The snow was heavy at times with a band of 3 to 5 inches across far northern Illinois and a band of 5 to 8 inches of snow across far northwest Illinois. Measured ice accumulations included 0.06 inches at Chicago O'Hare Airport and 0.02 inches at Chicago Midway Airport. Winds were gusting as high as 45 mph.

• Scattered thunderstorms moved across northern Illinois during the morning of February 27th producing three tornadoes and isolated wind damage. High winds developed during the evening of February 27th resulting in isolated wind damage in Chicago where a large tree fell onto two homes.

• Scattered thunderstorms moved across portions of northern Illinois during the afternoon of April 4th producing large hail and wind damage. High winds occurred north of these storms during the evening, producing isolated wind damage. Numerous vehicles were damaged and roof damage was reported near Grand Avenue and Division Street. Ping pong ball size hail was reported on the 5600 block of Bryn Mawr Avenue.
• Scattered thunderstorms moved across northern Illinois during the afternoon of April 20th producing large hail and wind damage. Trees and power lines were blown down in the 2400 block of Marquette Road.

• Severe drought conditions developed rapidly across northeast Illinois during the middle of June, which was referred to as a flash drought. Precipitation amounts were well below normal. The National Weather Service office in Romeoville measured 1.20 inches, which was 3.48 inches below normal. Chicago Midway Airport measured 2.08 inches, which was 1.93 inches below normal. Chicago O'Hare Airport measured 2.36 inches which was 1.74 inches below normal.

• A line of thunderstorms moved across east central Illinois during the early afternoon of June 29th producing mainly wind damage. Isolated thunderstorms developed across northeast Illinois during the afternoon. Photos shared on social media showed hail ranging from penny to quarter size.

• An extreme rainfall event occurred on July 2 in the Chicago metropolitan area. The area of peak rainfall just west of Chicago led to widespread flooding of basements, streets, and expressways. The storm temporarily flooded portions of the NASCAR racecourse in Chicago, causing a number of delays and cancellations of events. This weather event resulted in a presidential disaster declaration for Cook County.

• A cluster of strong thunderstorms brought damaging winds, torrential rainfall, and flash flooding to parts of northern Illinois during the afternoon and evening of July 5. In Chicago, roads were flooded, and a building was damaged by a fallen tree. Also, roads were blocked by a large tree branch that was blown down.

• During the afternoon of July 11, a broken line of strong thunderstorms moved across the Chicago metro. While most of these storms remained sub-severe, one cell stood out among the rest producing a 68 mph wind gust recorded by the ASOS at Chicago Midway Airport and downing nearby trees and power lines. One home was also damaged when an attached garage was struck by lightning.

• During the evening of July 12, scattered thunderstorms dropped 13 tornadoes across far northeast Illinois, primarily within the west of northwest suburbs of Chicago. After the first tornado in the O'Hare area lifted, a second EF-0 tornado touched down within the confines of O'Hare Airport just south of the 1-90 overpass over Touhy Ave. The tornado caused minor roofing and fascia damage to buildings and warehouses on the far north side of the airport.

• During the evening of July 14, severe thunderstorms brought damaging winds to northern Illinois as well as one EF-0 tornado that tracked from Warrenville to Glen Ellyn. Large tree limbs downed. Power lines were down in the Bucktown neighborhood of Chicago.

• High temperatures ranging from the middle 80s to middle 90s and dewpoint temperatures in the upper 70s and lower 80s resulted in a few days of uncomfortably hot weather across northern and central Illinois from the July 26th through the 28th. The afternoon of the 28th saw widespread heat indices in the 105-110°F range with some spots seeing heat indices between 110°F and 115°F.

• July 28th saw two rounds of severe storms move across the Chicago metro, one during the predawn hours of the morning and another during the evening. Trees and tree limbs being blown down in Chicago.
Scattered thunderstorms moved across northern Illinois during the afternoon and evening of August 14th producing a weak landspout tornado and a few funnel clouds. Heavy rain caused localized flash flooding in parts of Chicago. Viaducts were flooded with a car stalled in the flood water.

Chicago O'Hare Airport set a new daily record high of 98 degrees on August 23rd and also measured a dewpoint of 80 degrees. On August 24th, Chicago O'Hare Airport reached a daily record high of 100 degrees. The highest measured dewpoint was 79 degrees. The peak heat index value was 120 degrees, which is the highest measured heat index value in Chicago since records began.

Heavy rain fall across parts of northeast Illinois on September 17th producing flash flooding in parts of Cook County. A viaduct was flooded on Ashland Avenue between Hubbard Street and Lake Street with a report of a car under water. Heavy rain caused significant flooding and flash flooding across portions of southeast Cook County. Hundreds of roads were flooded and numerous cars were stranded in the flood waters. This weather event resulted in a presidential disaster declaration for Cook County.

Heavy rain caused localized flooding in parts of Chicago during the morning of September 26th. Street flooding was reported in the Armour Square, Bridgeport and Douglas neighborhoods of Chicago. State Street at 64th Street was temporarily impassable due to flooding and two stalled cars. A viaduct was flooded with a few stalled cars in the 1500 block of East 47th Street between Lake Park Avenue and Lake Shore Drive.

**Jurisdiction-Specific Hazards: Vulnerabilities and Impacts**

Hazards that represent a county-wide risk are addressed in the Risk Assessment section of the 2024 Cook County Multi-Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan Update. This section only addresses the hazards and their associated impacts that are relevant and unique to the municipality.

**Chicago Dept. of Aviation**

- **Dam/Levee Failure:** Dam failure concerns at Touhy Ave.
- **Flood:** Tunnels and I-90 are susceptible to flooding.

The following capabilities may be needed to mitigate the impacts of these hazards further:

- **Lightning:** Lightning detection system
- **Hail:** Emergency notifications
- **Extreme Cold:** Back up of all heating systems
- **Tornado:** Siren system updates. P.A. system upgrade. Visual alert system.

**Jurisdiction-Specific Hazards: Vulnerabilities and Impacts - CDPH**

- **Flood:** Limitations with sewer system size and capacity for water runoff. Lakefront erosion and potential loss of East N/S evacuation road (LSD).
- **Extreme Heat:** Long-term care and senior living facilities lack electric panel conversions to receive external power source/generator power.
- **Drought:** There may be a need to enhance water distribution networks. Medical wastewater systems rely on water to clean medical equipment and infrastructure. Lack of water caused by drought may impact functionality and patient care.
• **Extreme Cold:** Lack of overnight housing or sustained sheltering for the homeless population.

• **Disease Transmission:** Chicago has a very transient visitor population. There is a greater need for a global early warning system to mitigate/prevent infectious disease transfer (Aviation, Rail, etc.). Lack of isolation/quarantine housing for patients under investigation (PUI) for high-consequence disease exposures (SARS, Pandemic, Ebola, etc.).

• **Earthquake:** Power outages from earthquakes may be acutely impactful on medically dependent of supported populations. Special considerations should be made to harden infrastructure for LTCs and FQHCs.

• **Severe Weather:** Ordinances do not address all housing stock options, allowing impacts of extreme heat/cold to impact populations that do not meet ordinance requirements. Power/heat/cooling infrastructure in high CCVI and other community areas are not sufficient to meet the needs of local residents, leading to disproportionate impacts on these communities.

• **Tornado:** Tornados may damage hospital infrastructure and back up power generation. Many Chicago hospitals are located close together in densely populated areas. Damage and debris may prevent access to these locations and impact patients receiving care and those that require care from injuries sustained from the tornado.

• **Severe Winter Weather:** Ordinances do not address all housing stock options, allowing impacts of extreme heat/cold to impact populations that do not meet ordinance requirements. Power/heat/cooling infrastructure in high CCVI and other community areas are not sufficient to meet the needs of local residents, leading to disproportionate impacts on these communities.

• **Dam and Levee Failure:** Many hospitals, LTCs, and FQHCs are within the floodplain for the Chicago and Des Plaines rivers. While no dams exist in the Chicago area, a failure in a nearby portion of the Chicago MSA may cause water infiltration within or near these facilities.

• **Flooding:** Many hospitals, LTCs, and FQHCs are within the floodplain for the Chicago and Des Plaines rivers. While no dams exist in the Chicago area, a failure in a nearby portion of the Chicago MSA may cause water infiltration within or near these facilities.

• **Wildfire (Wildfire Smoke):** Wildfire smoke produces downwind smoke inhalation and associated medical impacts. Chicago has a large number of residents that have baseline respiratory health concerns due to living in urban areas with air quality concerns. Additional exposure to wildfire smoke may exacerbate these conditions and seek to an influx of residents seeking care.

**Jurisdiction-Specific Hazards: Vulnerabilities and Impacts - DWM**

• **Flood:**
  - Flooding certainly has been a problem and most likely will continue in the future. DWM resources have been maximized to provide mitigation for communities that are flooded.
  - The wards on the city's southeast side often struggle to recover from property damage. Non-English speakers have difficulty getting information regarding basement flooding initiatives or "Alert Chicago." Sewers can be impacted by urban flooding and overflow.
With approximately 26 miles of shoreline, the City of Chicago is more vulnerable to shoreline flooding than other Cook County lakefront municipalities. (The next highest community has 4 miles of shoreline).

- **Extreme Heat:**
  - Historically, prolonged extreme heat incidents have severely impacted the senior/elderly population in the City.
  - Hydrants being utilized during an extreme heat incident could adversely affect the City from suppressing and managing fires.

- **High Winds:**
  - High winds have made many households vulnerable to power outages. These incidents will result in damaged facilities.

- **Severe Winter Weather/Extreme Cold:**
  - Snow and extreme cold have historically affected the City and, depending on the severity, have even shut down the City.
  - Those dependent on public transportation are at the most significant risk (food, work, appointments, medical, etc.). Senior citizens in the City are also very vulnerable. Residents in Chicago may be susceptible to frozen pipes during an extreme cold incident. Response times for maintenance crews might be longer.
  - Recent extreme cold incidents resulted in water services being frozen throughout the City.

- **Tornado:**
  - During a tornado or other severe event that results in a loss of power, they may be unable to treat and pump water to citizens.

- **Lightning and Severe Storms:**
  - Loss of power could affect the operational viability of pumping stations.

**Jurisdiction-Specific Hazards: Vulnerabilities and Impacts - MWRD**

- **Drought:**
  - Water quality could become difficult to maintain.

- **Earthquake:**
  - MWRD facilities and wastewater treatment could be interrupted depending on how severe the earthquake is.

- **Severe Weather:**
  - Severe weather such as high winds, lightning, hail, etc. could affect or interrupt the operation of wastewater facilities. The entire population of Cook County could be impacted.

- **Tornado:**
  - Tornadoes can damage or interrupt power to wastewater facilities and affect or interrupt operation.

- **Severe Winter Weather:**
  - Severe winter weather could affect/interrupt wastewater treatment. The entire population of Cook County could be impacted.

- **Dam and Levee Failure:**
If dams fail, the ability to manage stormwater will be impacted, causing flooding in those areas.

- **Flooding:**
  - MWRD has stormwater management authority for Cook County. If local sewers become overwhelmed with stormwater, flow to MWRD sewers (interceptors) can become restricted.

Data are from the U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey. See methods for more information.

The community evaluated whether vulnerability, and subsequently the potential impacts, in hazard-prone areas had increased, decreased, or remained the same for each natural hazard identified in this Hazard Mitigation Plan. Climate change, infrastructure expansion, and economic shifts that can affect vulnerability were considered. For example, if planned development is in an identified hazard area or is not built to the updated building codes, it may increase the community's vulnerability to future hazards and disasters. On the other hand, if development occurred with mitigation practices in place, the vulnerability may have remained the same or decreased. Additionally, shifting demographics were taken into consideration when assessing development trends.

**Jurisdiction-Specific Climate Change Vulnerability and Impacts**

The table below outlines if climate change, as assessed by the local planning team, has increased or decreased the municipality's vulnerability/exposure, and thereby the potential impacts, to each natural hazard over the past five (5) years (Current Vulnerability), and the effect of climate change in the future probability of occurrence and impacts (Future Vulnerability) from each natural hazard.

Future studies are needed to better understand the impact of climate change on the community's assets.

| Hazard                                      | Vulnerability |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Dam and Levee Failure                       | Remained the Same |
| Drought                                     | Remained the Same |

| Wildfire (Wildfire Smoke) | Increase |

### Jurisdiction-Specific Changes (or Expected Changes) in Development Trends in Hazard-Prone Areas

The table below outlines if development, as assessed by the local planning team, over the past five (5) years (Current Vulnerability) has increased or decreased the jurisdiction's vulnerability/exposure, and thereby the potential impacts, to these natural hazards, and the anticipated effects changes in development may have on the future probability of occurrence and impacts (Future Vulnerability) from these natural hazards.

| Hazard | Vulnerability |
| --- | --- |
| Dam and Levee Failure | Remained the Same |
| Drought | Remained the Same |
| Earthquake | Increase |
| Flood (Riverine, Urban, Shoreline) | Increase |
| Severe Weather (Extreme Heat, Lightning, Hail, Fog, High Wings) | Increase |
| Severe Winter Weather (Ice Storms, Heavy Snow, Blizzards, Extreme Cold) | Increase |
| Tornado | Increase |
| Wildfire (Wildfire Smoke) | Increase |
Population and Development Trends

Future major assets include:

- Development of Sterling Bay parcels adjacent to the north branch of the Chicago River may result in structures or infrastructure that is susceptible to flooding.
- Community areas that were disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, are likely to continue to be most impacted by public health and other emergencies, including natural hazards. These communities remain susceptible to negative health, economic, and material outcomes during emergencies.
- New Arrivals to Chicago are socially and economically vulnerable to natural hazards. These individuals may be unstably housed or in congregate shelters, with limited resources, that increase the opportunity to be exposed to severe weather, flooding, severe winter weather, illnesses, smoke inhalation, etc.

Hazard Risk Ranking

The Hazard Risk Ranking Table below presents the ranking of the hazards of concern. Hazard area extent and location maps are included at the end of this chapter. These maps are based on the best available data at the time of the preparation of this plan, and are considered to be adequate for planning purposes.

| Rank | Hazard Type          |
|------|----------------------|
| 1    | Severe Weather       |
| 2    | Severe Winter Weather|
| 3    | Tornado              |

| Benefits of the Mitigation Project (Loss Avoided or Issue Being Mitigated) | High | Action/Implementation Plan and Project Description: | Our Roots Chicago is a multi-departmental, data-informed, community-driven strategy to expand the tree canopy in Chicago through an equitable approach focusing on South and West side communities. The goal is to plant 75,000 new trees in 5 years through the $46 million Chicago Recovery Plan investment. The City uses the 'community tree equity tool' - which overlays data on tree canopy with asthma, air quality, land surface temperatures, and other social vulnerability and environmental factors - to plant trees where there is the greatest need. The identification of tree planting locations is supported by a diverse, 160 member community-based Tree Equity Working Group created and convened by CDPH. CDPH also leads Tree Ambassador trainings in priority communities to train residents how to survey and submit potential tree planting |
sites on behalf of residents through 3-1-1 based on the Chicago Landscape Ordinance, performed in partnership with The Morton Arboretum and the DSS Bureau of Forestry. There are 19 community organizations funded in the Tree Ambassador Program, and The Arboretum will be providing $640,000 in Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding received through the U.S. Forest Service to support 32 additional Tree Ambassador community organizations in their work over the next two to four years. The trees are then planted by the City's Department of Streets and Sanitation Bureau of Forestry and Department of Transportation and are warrantied for two years free of charge. The priority communities include: West Lawn, West Garfield Park, Fuller Park, North Lawndale, East Garfield Park, Chicago Lawn, Riverdale, Englewood, Oakland, West Englewood, Armour Square, Austin, Washington Park, Auburn Gresham, Greater Grand Crossing, Archer Heights, Humboldt Park, West Elsdon, Gage Park, Brighton Park, New City, and South Lawndale. In 2022, the city planted over 18,000 parkway trees; in 2023, over 23,000 parkway trees have been planted, for a total of over 41,000 public parkway trees planted; and the city is well on its way to reaching the 5-year goal. Recently, through another IRA grant, $3 million for the City of Chicago and $1.5 million for the Chicago Park District for separate projects that will involve significant community engagement and job creation for work including the development of Urban Forestry Management Plans and a 100% inventory of the city's public trees. In the future, through the City's existing work on HeatWatch and CoolChi program, when the Heat Vulnerability Index is completed, the data will help update the tool used to prioritize and allocate tree plantings and assist community organizations, residents, and Tree Ambassadors to better request and plant trees for both public and private plantings to reduce hospitalizations and deaths from extreme heat and better mitigate urban heat island effects.

Type 1 Narrative Rezoning Analysis attached to this ordinance reads as follows:
The Project

The property is improved with a partial two-story and partial one-story building with a commercial space in the front of the ground floor containing 1,017 square feet and the balance of the building being used for an architectural office. The property has no parking, and none is proposed. The Applicant seeks to rezone the property to allow the existing commercial space in the front of the ground floor to be used for a small venue with a capacity not to exceed 80 individuals. The venue will be used only for private events with no liquor sales, live music, or DJs permitted. The building's height is and will remain at 30.40 feet.

The property is located on the northeast corner of West Grand Avenue and North Wolcott Avenue. The area along Grand Avenue is primarily improved with a variety of buildings ranging from one to four stories and used for single-family and multi-family residential as well as commercial and industrial uses. North of Grand Avenue is an area with primarily residential uses and south of Grand Avenue the area is primarily used for commercial and industrial uses. To allow the proposed development, the Applicant seeks a change in zoning classification for the subject property from the property's current M1-2 to a B3-2 district under a Mandatory Type I Map Amendment. The area has a mix of zoning classifications, including RS-3, RT-4, RM-5, B1-3, B2-2, B2-3, B3-3, C3-2, M1-2, and PMD-4. It is improved with some buildings of similar size, scale, and density to the subject building. The is a TSL location to the CTA Green Line Station at Damen and Lake that is 2,246 feet from the property. The Applicant seeks the B3-2 classification to authorize the proposed Indoor Event Venue as a Special Use and to reduce the required parking from eight spaces to zero.

The following are the relevant zoning parameters for the proposed project:

- **Lot Area:** 2,373 square feet
- **Floor Area:** 3,776.5 square feet
- **Maximum FAR:** 1.60
- **Residential Dwelling Units:** None
- **MLA Density:** N/A
- **Height:** 30.40 feet
- **Bicycle Parking:** None

Be It Ordained by the City Council of the City of Chicago:

SECTION 1. Title 17 of the Municipal Code of Chicago, the Chicago Zoning Ordinance, is hereby amended by changing all of the RS3 Residential Single-Unit Detached House District symbols and indications as shown on Map Number 1-H in the area bounded by:

West Ontario Street; a line 192 feet east of and parallel to North Paulina Street;

Type 1 Narrative Rezoning Analysis attached to this ordinance reads as follows:
The petitioner is proposing to renovate an existing two dwelling unit multi-family residential building located at 1638 W. Ohio Street. The property exists on a sub-standard sized lot (78'x24') and faces two streets (Ohio Street and Ontario Street), making it a Through Lot with what is technically two “front” yards. The proposed renovation will include an increase from two stories to three along with adding a roof deck to the existing garage. The petitioner is requesting an approval of a rezoning from RS-3 to RM-4.5 to accommodate the increase in floor area ratio to 1.25 and increase in height to 32'-11.” The existing structure also presents two nonconforming developments under Section 17-15-0401, as the building was lawfully constructed in 1878 but is now not in compliance with side and rear yard setback requirements.

Under section 17-13-0303-D, the applicant seeks variances to allow for reduced setbacks for the side and rear yard. A variance is sought under Section 17-13-1101-B to reduce the minimum required setback from the front property line along Ohio Street from 9.36' to 4.10' in order to legalize the construction of the third floor. A variance is sought under Section 17-13-1101-B to reduce the minimum required west side yard setback from 2.00' to 0.50' and to reduce the required combined setback from 4.80' to 3.50.' The construction of the third floor described above will not extend the current footprint of the building into the setbacks, and the requested setbacks reflect the structure of the existing nonconforming development of the property. Along with the extant nonconforming development, the substandard size of the lot necessitates these reduced setback allowances. In addition, a variance is sought under Section 17-13-1101-B to reduce the minimum required setback for parking from the front property line along Ontario Street from 20.00' to 0.00' (ZERO). An additional variance is sought under 17-13-1101-B, to legalize the construction of the rooftop deck upon the garage, which will not extend the current footprint of the garage and the requested setback reflects the structure of the existing nonconforming development of the garage.

Specifically, the renovation of the building will consist of adding a third floor to the building, creating a two-bedroom two-story duplex on floors two and three of the building with a roof deck on top of the building; a general renovation of the one-bedroom first floor unit, which shall not involve construction outside the current building envelope; and the construction of a roof deck upon the existing garage on Ontario Street. A specific floor plan of the proposed layout is enclosed with this application. The existing structure will also be repaired and/or replaced as necessary. The addition of the third floor will involve increasing the height of the structure to 32'-11.”

The proposed renovation will significantly improve the community’s appreciation of a property that has been in disuse and poor condition for many years. The proposed renovation will improve the aesthetic appeal of the property, as well as bring the structure into better conformity with the surrounding parcels.

Type 1 Narrative Rezoning Analysis attached to this ordinance reads as follows:
The Project

The property is improved with a three-story "L" shaped building with a partially completed fourth floor addition. The existing improvements contains two completed residential dwelling units and one partially completed residential unit. The Applicant seeks to rezone the property to allow rehabilitation of the existing building by completion of the fourth-floor addition on top of the existing building and construction of a new four-story addition (the "New Addition") east and north of the existing building. After completion of the fourth-floor addition on the existing building and the New Addition, the building will contain a total of twenty-six (26) residential dwelling units with eleven (11) parking spaces in the ground floor of the New Addition. Roof-top decks will be provided on top of the fourth-floor addition on the existing building and on top of the New Addition. The building's height, including the proposed additions, as measured to the main parapet will be 55 feet 2.5 inches, and to the parapet of the elevator penthouse 68 feet 4.5 inches.

The property is located on the southeast corner of North Wood Street and West Potomac Avenue. The area is primarily improved with multi-family buildings ranging in height from two stories to four stories. To allow the proposed development, the Applicant seeks a change in zoning classification for the subject property from the property's current RS-3 to an RM-6 under a Mandatory Type I Map Amendment. The area has a mix of zoning classifications, including RS-3, RT-4, RM4.5, RM-5, RM-5.5, B3-2 and B2-3. It is improved with some buildings of similar size, scale, and density to the subject building as proposed to be redeveloped. The property is a Transit Served Location per the Transit-Oriented Provisions of the Chicago Zoning Ordinance, Section 17-10-0102-B (1), as it is located the requisite distances from designated bus line corridor in Table 17-17-0400-B, as follows 452 feet from Division Street (CTA Routes 36 & 70), 938 feet from Milwaukee Avenue (CTA Routes 56, 68, 76, 85/8SA, 81, 88, 91 & 92), and 1147 feet from Ashland Avenue (CT Routes 9, X9 & 63). It also is within the requisite distances to two CTA Blue Line station entrances being 1,135 feet from the CTA Division Blue Line station entrance and 2,345 feet from the CTA Damen Blue Line station entrance. Accordingly, the property qualifies for a parking reduction under the Transit Served provision of the Zoning Ordinance.

The Applicant also seeks as part of the Type I rezoning per Section 17-13-0303-D: 1) Variations under Section 17-13-1101-B to reduce the required front yard from 15.0 feet to 11.18 feet, the require rear setback from 30.0 feet to 1.75 feet and the required east side setback from 14.4 feet to 0.0 feet, with west side setback at 3 ft. 8.5 in.; 2) a Variation under 17-13-1003-EE to reduce the required parking from 26 spaces to 10 spaces; 3) a Variation under Section 17-13-1003-LL to reduce the required percentage of EVSE-ready and/or EVSE-installed spaces to 20%; and 4) a Variation under Section 17-13-1101-D to reduce the required loading berths from 1 to none.

The following are the relevant zoning parameters for the proposed project:

- **Lot Area:** 14,400 square feet
- **Floor Area:** 36,552.80 square feet
- **Maximum FAR:** 2.60
- **Residential Dwelling Units:** 26

17-3-0308 Specific Criteria for Transit-Served Locations. In B and C districts, any new construction within 2,640 feet of a CTA or METRA rail station entrance or exit must satisfy all of the following specific criteria:

1. The project complies with the applicable standards of Section 17-10-0102-B;

   The Property is approximately 1,056 feet from the Damen Pink Line Station; therefore, the Property is a transit-served location under Section 17-10-0102-B.

2. The project complies with the standards and regulations of Section 17-3-0504, except paragraph H if the project is not located along a pedestrian street and except paragraph C if the land use is designated in a non-commercial use group, pertaining to pedestrian streets and pedestrian retail streets, even if the project is not located along a pedestrian street or a pedestrian retail street;

   The Project complies with Section 17-3-0504-B because the building abuts 18th Place. The Project does not need to comply with Section 17-3-0504-C because this is a residential building. The Project complies with Section 17-3-0504-D because the building has a primary entrance on 18th Street Avenue to access the first-floor unit. Section 17-3-0504-E does not apply to this residential building. The Project complies with Section 17-3-0504-F and G because all parking is accessed from the rear public alley and not visible from 18th Place. Section 17-3-0504-H does not apply to this residential building. Section 17-3-0504-I does not apply to this all residential building.

3. The project complies with the general goals set forth in the Transit Friendly Development Guide: Station Area Typology, and any other station-specific plans, designs, or guidelines adopted by the Chicago Plan Commission;

   The project complies with the general goal set forth in the Transit Friendly Development Guide: Station Area Typology by adding density near CTA train stations and CTA bus lines. The Project will only provide two parking spaces which will encourage residents to use public transportation. The Damen Pink Line Station is an Urban Neighborhood that is characterized as primarily multifamily uses where density is encouraged through infill opportunities similar to the proposed project. Thus, the project complies with the general goal set forth in the Transit Friendly Development Guide: Station Area Typology.

4. Residential building projects shall not have a number of parking spaces in excess of 50% of the Minimum Automobile Parking Ratio for the applicable district listed in Section 17-10-0207 with any fractional result rounded up to the next higher whole number, unless additional parking spaces are approved as an administrative adjustment under the provisions of Section 17-13-1003-EE; and

   The project complies with this standard because the project will only provide 2 parking spaces for residents (through a parking reduction) for the 6 dwelling units. Therefore, the project will
not have a number of parking spaces in excess of 50% of the requirement under Section 17-10-0207.

5. The project complies with the Travel Demand Study and Management Plan rules of the Chicago Department of Transportation. The City's Commissioner of Transportation is authorized to issue Travel Demand Study and Management Plan rules consistent with this section.

This does not apply to the proposed project because the project will only establish 6 dwelling units.

- The project meets 100% of the ARO requirements with 8 on site units and is eligible for an MLA reduction per 17-3-0402-B.
- 17-3-0308 Specific Criteria for Transit-Served Locations.
  In B and C districts, any new construction within 2,640 feet of a CTA or Metra rail station entrance or exit must satisfy all of the following specific criteria:
1. The project complies with the applicable standards of Section 17-10-0102-B;

The scope of this project details the construction of a new residential building that will contain a total of (38) thirty-eight dwelling units and off-street accessory parking for (19) nineteen vehicles. This 50% reduction in required parking ratio complies with guidelines set forth in Sections 17-3-0308 and 17-10-0102-B(1).

A new bicycle storage room exclusive to residents has been proposed, providing all required bicycle parking spaces ((38) thirty-eight required, (40) forty spaces proposed, minimum one per dwelling unit). The bicycle storage room is located on the first floor, with access through the main lobby as well as a limited use gate along Campbell Ave, making it very accessible to residents in the building.

2. The project complies with the standards and regulations of Section 17-3-0504, except paragraph H if the project is not located along a pedestrian street and except paragraph C if the land use is designated in a non-commercial use group, pertaining to pedestrian streets and pedestrian retail streets, even if the project is not located along a pedestrian street or a pedestrian retail street;

The design of the proposed building shows the entire Fullerton Ave facade set back (3) three feet from the property line. Similarly, the Campbell Ave facade is set back 5.80 feet from the property line. Per the design, there are two primary pedestrian entrances along Fullerton Ave (one serving a common shared tenant space and one serving a private residence). The primary residential entrance is located along Campbell Ave along with a limited access gate serving the vehicular parking as well as bicycle storage room.

A minimum of 60% of each street facing facade will be comprised of transparent non-reflective windows and doors.

All of the required off-street parking will be located within the bounds of the property and will not be visible from Campbell Ave. An iron fence with masonry columns has been proposed to shield the view of cars from the street. Access to the exterior off-street parking will be accommodated through the alley on the East side of the property.

3. The project complies with the general goals set forth in the Transit Friendly Development Guide: Station Area Typology, and any other station-specific plans, designs or guidelines adopted by the Chicago Plan Commission;

In order to satisfy our compliance with the requirements set forth by the Transit Friendly Development Guide, below are ways in which we address all applicable criteria.

Compliance with section 17-13-0905-F (c): Station Area and Typology
In accordance with the transit friendly development guide “Urban Neighborhood (UN)” criteria, our building provides a dense residential building. Our five story building provides thirty-eight (38) dwelling units with elevator access, making it inclusive to a variety of residents. Diverse unit sizes ranging from one to three bedrooms are proposed.

This project will comply with the 2021 Affordable Requirements Ordinance (ARO) designating 20% (8 dwelling units) of the total number of (38) dwelling units as “affordable.” The design calls for 100% of those (8) eight required affordable units to be located on-site and be evenly dispersed throughout the proposed new building.

Furthermore, our building provides residents with a common shared space on the ground floor, a common roof deck on the main building as well as private deck and balcony spaces within dwelling units.

**Compliance with section 17-13-0905-F (d): Promote public transit and automobile alternatives**

In an effort to promote public transportation and other vehicular alternatives, we have provided all required bicycle parking spaces (38 required, 40 spaces proposed, minimum one per dwelling unit). The bicycle parking is located within a bike room off of the main lobby, making it very accessible to residents in the building. All bicycle spaces will be on a two-tiered rack system.

Alternatively, there is an existing Divvy bicycle station on the public way, directly outside of the main entry on Campbell Ave. This station will remain on the public way and provides an additional 15 bicycles available to the neighborhood.

Vehicular parking has been provided with a ratio not more than 50% of the minimum automobile parking ratio for the applicable district listed in section 17-10-0207. Our building provides (1) one off-street parking space for every (2) two dwelling units. All off-street parking spaces are secured with a security gate, reserved for tenant use only.

**Compliance with section 17-13-0905-F (e): Pedestrian Related Improvements**

In accordance with the pedestrian related improvements portion of the code, our site is providing the following: Maintaining five existing trees along Fullerton Ave and Campbell Ave. The existing Divvy station will remain of the public way adjacent to the property. See sheet T1.0 for Pedestrian Related Improvements.
4. Residential building projects shall not have a number of parking spaces in excess of 50% of the Minimum Automobile Parking Ratio for the applicable district listed in Section 17-10-0207 with any fractional result rounded up to the next higher whole number, unless additional parking spaces are approved as an administrative adjustment under the provisions of Section 17-13-1003-EE;

The scope of this project details the construction of a new residential building that will contain a total of (38) thirty-eight dwelling units and off-street accessory parking for (19) nineteen vehicles. This 50% reduction in required parking ratio complies with guidelines set forth in Sections 17-3-0308 and 17-10-0102-B(1).

5. The project complies with the Travel Demand Study and Management Plan rules of the Chicago Department of Transportation. The City's Commissioner of Transportation is authorized to issue Travel Demand Study and Management Plan rules consistent with this section.

In an effort to promote alternative and public forms of transportation, the proposed development will provide (1) one designated off-street parking space for every (2) two dwelling units, offered on a first come basis. These considerations will attract residents who more often rely on alternative or public forms of transit. Additionally, the building contains a large storage room on the first floor capable of accommodating (40) forty bicycles/scooters.

Aside from the on-site accommodations, there is an existing Divvy station along Campbell Ave, directly outside of the proposed main residential entrance. The existing station will remain and contains approximately (15) fifteen bicycle docks.

PROJECT NARRATIVE AND PLANS
1821 W. Berteau Avenue

The Applicant seeks to rezone 1821 West Berteau Avenue from a RS-3 Residential Single-Unit (Detached House) District to B2-3 Neighborhood Mixed-Use District to re-establish an Office use. The subject property is improved with a three-story commercial building with approximately 18,780 square feet of commercial space. No vehicle parking spaces is provided. The subject property's previous use, office space, was considered legal nonconforming, but the Applicant's tenant moved out over a year ago with no business license. Thus, to re-establish the office use, the Applicant must bring the subject property into a compliant zoning district. No construction is currently contemplated; therefore, the building height of 46 feet will remain unchanged. The Property is a Transit-Served Location as it is approximately 1,584 feet from the Irving Park Brown Line Station.

Pursuant to Section 17-13-0303-D, the Applicant seeks to reduce the off-street parking requirement to zero pursuant to Section 17-13-1003-EE. Pursuant to Section 17-13-1101-B, the Applicant seeks to reduce the front setback, the side setbacks (East and West), and rear setback to 0 feet required under Section 17-3-0405-B.

15. The Applicant acknowledges that it is the policy of the City to maximize opportunities for Minority- and Women-owned Business Enterprises ("M/WBEs") and city residents to compete for contracts and jobs on construction projects approved through the planned development process.

First, the applicant must submit to DPD, as part of its application for planned development approval, an M/WBE Participation Proposal. The M/WBE Participation Proposal must identify the applicant's goals for participation of certified M/WBE firms in the design, engineering and construction of the project, and of city residents in the construction work. The City encourages goals of: (i) 26 percent MBE and 6 percent WBE participation (measured against the total construction budget for the project or any phase thereof), and (ii) 50 percent city resident hiring (measured against the total construction work hours for the project or any phase thereof). The M/WBE Participation Proposal must include a description of the applicant's proposed outreach plan designed to inform M/WBEs and city residents of job and contracting opportunities. Second, at the time of the applicant's submission for Part II permit review for the project or any phase thereof, the applicant must submit to DPD: (a) updates (if any) to the applicant's preliminary outreach plan; (b) a description of the applicant's outreach efforts and evidence of such outreach, including, without limitation, copies of certified letters to M/WBE contractor associations and the ward office of the alderman in which the project is located and receipts thereof; (c) responses to the applicant's outreach efforts; and (d) updates (if any) to the applicant's M/WBE and city resident participation goals. Third, prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for the project or any phase thereof, the applicant must provide DPD with the actual level of M/WBE and city resident participation in the project or any phase thereof, and evidence of such participation. In addition to the foregoing, DPD may request such additional information as the department determines may be necessary or useful in evaluating the extent to which M/WBEs and city residents are informed of and utilized in planned development projects. All such information will be provided in a form acceptable to the Zoning Administrator. DPD will report the data it collects regarding projected and actual employment of M/WBEs and city residents in planned development projects twice yearly to the Chicago Plan Commission and annually to the Chicago City Council and the Mayor.

16. This Planned Development shall be governed by Section 17-13-0612. Should this Planned Development ordinance lapse, the Zoning Administrator shall initiate a zoning map amendment to rezone the Property to the B3-3 Community Shopping District.

TRIBUTE TO LATE CILVICE HARRIS ROBINSON.

WHEREAS, Almighty God, in His infinite wisdom and judgment, has called Cillice Harris Robinson, an outstanding citizen of the City of Chicago, to her everlasting reward and returned to the heavenly realm on December 27, 2024; and

WHEREAS, This august Chicago City Council body has been informed of her passing by the Honorable Michelle A. Harris, Alderperson of the 8th Ward; and

WHEREAS, Mrs. Cillice Harris Robinson was born May 19, 1936, alongside her beloved twin brother Massie, to the late Mitchell and Nettie Harris in Lexington, Mississippi. Cillice was the youngest of nine siblings and was affectionately called “Baby Sister” by her family and friends. From a young age, she embraced her Christian faith by embarking on her spiritual journey at Holy City Baptist Church in Ebenezer, Mississippi, where the seed of her deep love for God was first planted; and

WHEREAS, Cillice began her academic career in the Holmes County School District at Cypress Chapel in Ebenezer, Mississippi. In 1954, she would forgo her education and move to Detroit, Michigan, where devotion to her family led to helping in the nurturing of her nieces and nephews. During that period, her selflessness became a beacon of love, integrity, and gratitude for her family and friends. Her heart was as vast as her spirit was generous. Cillice’s compassionate nature reached far beyond the walls of her home, touching the lives of many others; and

WHEREAS, In 1957, Cillice moved to Chicago, Illinois, where she began working alongside her twin brother Massie at Union Linen Laundry. On December 23, 1959, she had
her first child, Michael Robinson. As fate would have it, her journey led her to the love of her life, Mr. Isaac Robinson. It was as if serendipity intervened, bringing Cillice and Isaac together through her niece Ann Minner's husband, Al Minner, who was Isaac's barber. On July 14, 1960, Cillice and Isaac were joined in holy matrimony. Throughout their marriage, Cillice was the loving wife. Together they displayed unwavering support, deep compassion, and unconditional love; and

WHEREAS, Cillice and Isaac shared over 60 years of marriage, and they built an extraordinary life together filled with love, faith, family, and friends. They shared three children: two sons, Michael and Isaac, Jr., and a daughter, Anita Fay Robinson-Griffith. Cillice was their greatest supporter, constantly encouraging them to pursue education and motivating them to work hard, embrace life enthusiastically, always give their best, and never settle regardless of the path they chose. Cillice's family was her greatest treasure and she, theirs; and

WHEREAS, Cillice's professional life was marked by dedication and excellence. For over seven years, she and her husband Isaac owned Tastee Freeze Ice Cream in Chicago, Illinois. She worked at Union Linen Laundry as a laundry presser, at Kennedy-King College where she was the culinary specialist, and concluded her career at the Marriott Hotel as a laundry supervisor, where she dedicated over 25 years of service. Each role, big or small, was embraced with a spirit of excellence that reflected her character; and

WHEREAS, Above all, Cillice centered her life around her faith and her family. Over the years, she was a member of several churches, ultimately finding a true Christian home at The Way of Truth Church Baptist on March 7, 1981. Throughout her time there, she became a beacon of warmth and love within her church community. As a founding member, she devoted herself to serving as an usher, sharing her melodic voice with the Sanctuary Choir, and actively participating in both the Deacons and Ministers Wives Ministry and the Mother's Board Ministry. Even as her health began to decline, her faith and commitment remained steadfast; and

WHEREAS, Forever the gracious hostess, Cillice's kindness knew no bounds. A candid truth-teller who was celebrated for her honesty and directness. Known for her culinary skills as her kitchen was always a place filled with the intoxicating aroma of her southern roots. Cillice had a passion for cooking and she enjoyed sharing her delicious meals with everyone whether at church or in her neighborhood. Her compassionate spirit shone brightly as she frequently visited the local food pantry to gather food and prepare meals for those in need. In her spare time, she found joy in gardening and decorating her home, especially during the holidays. Her green thumb and creative spirit brought beauty to her surroundings and joy to those around her. Most of all, her smile and laugh were contagious as she was the life of every gathering; and

WHEREAS, Mississippi, Michigan, and Minnesota held special places in her heart. They were her cherished homes away from home. Wherever she went, her vivacious personality illuminated the room, with her love for card games and casino visits reflecting her zest for life. Renowned as the family's "fashionista", her stylish outfits and exquisite church hats spoke volumes of her personality; and
WHEREAS, Cillice is now reunited with her adored parents, eight beloved siblings, her devoted husband, Isaac Robinson, Sr., her two loving sons, Micheal and Isaac, Jr., and her adorable granddaughter Zaria L. Griffith; and

WHEREAS, Cillice leaves to cherish her fondest memories her loving daughter: Anita Fay Robinson-Griffith (Cedric); grandchildren, LaNina Hall, Aaron Boone (Samantha), Shanetta Clemmons (Omar), Aaliyah Griffith, and Mya Griffith; great-grandchildren, Wynter Gary, Ramari Boone, Raishawn Clemmons, Annabelle Boone, Amir Clemmons, Jordyn Burnett, Adylynn Boone, and Austin Clemmons; sister/niece, Earlene Deering; brother-in-law, Clifton J. Muhammad; best friends, Peggy Woods and Lucille Morgan; great-granddog, Khozen Griffith; goddaughters, Yolanda Godwin, Joan Dansby, Brenda Mims, and Alisha Lee; and godsons, Henry McGary and Bishop Daniel W. Lee, Sr.; along with a host of nieces, nephews, cousins, family, and friends; now, therefore,

Be It Resolved, That the Mayor and members of the City Council of the City of Chicago, do hereby express our deep sorrow on the passing of and extend to her family our sincere condolences; and

Be It Further Resolved, That a suitable copy of this resolution be prepared and presented to the family of Mrs. Cillice Harris Robinson.

CALL FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP TO ASSESS AND REDESIGN SPEED LIMIT ENFORCEMENT STRUCTURE AND PRACTICES. [SR2024-0010992]

On motion of Alderperson La Spata, the City Council took up for consideration the report of the Committee on Pedestrian and Traffic Safety, deferred and ordered published in the Journal of the Proceedings of the City Council of the City of Chicago of October 22, 2024, page 19108, recommending that the City Council adopt the proposed substitute resolution printed on pages 19108 through 19110, concerning the establishment of an interagency working group to assess and redesign speed limit enforcement structure and practices in the City of Chicago.

On motion of Alderperson La Spata, the said proposed substitute resolution was then Adopted by yeas and nays as follows:

Yeas -- Alderpersons La Spata, Dowell, Robinson, Yancy, Hall, Mitchell, Harris, Beale, Chico, Lee, Ramirez, Quinn, Gutiérrez, Lopez, Coleman, Moore, Curtis, O'Shea, Taylor, Mosley, Rodríguez, Tabares, Scott, Sigcho-Lopez, Fuentes, Burnett, Ervin, Taliaferro, Cruz, Cardona, Waguespack, Rodríguez-Sánchez, Conway, Ramirez-Rosa, Villegas, Mitts, Sposato, Nugent, Vasquez, Napolitano, Reilly, Knudsen, Lawson, Gardiner, Clay, Martin, Manaa-Hoppenworth, Hadden, Silverstein -- 49.

Nays -- Alderperson Hopkins -- 1.

Alderperson Mitchell moved to reconsider the foregoing vote. The motion was lost.

The following is said substitute resolution as adopted:

WHEREAS, There are currently 162 speed cameras installed in the City of Chicago, located in about 68 of Chicago's nearly 1,500 Safety Zones; and

WHEREAS, The City has established six geographical regions wherein no fewer than 10 percent of all speed enforcement safety zones will be located to ensure a geographically equitable distribution of the program; and

WHEREAS, Historically, the intensity of ticketing for speed cameras is highest in the predominantly Black and Latine areas of the city, and majority Black areas receive the highest number of tickets per household, followed by the majority Latine areas; and

WHEREAS, The built and social environments, including characteristics like lower population density and wide, multi-lane roadways, in predominantly Black and Latine areas increase the ability of drivers to more easily drive at excessive speeds; and
WHEREAS, In 2023, five speed cameras issued over $2 Million in tickets, and three of those five cameras were located on the South Side; and

WHEREAS, In 2023, 1,562,413 speeding tickets were issued, and speed cameras brought in $46.9 Million from the base fines paid on time and almost $55.4 Million from late fees; and

WHEREAS, The ability to pay precludes upper-income households from the most punitive effects of tickets fines and fees and may have negligible impacts on driver compliance while poor and working-class families are more likely to incur penalties for non- or late payment, which can lead to towing, impoundment, debt, and corresponding collateral damages; and

WHEREAS, Ticket-induced economic hardships and shocks can further negatively impact the relationship of Black and Latine communities with law enforcement; and

WHEREAS, Revenues from automated speed enforcement systems can only be spent on four specific purposes, one of which includes initiatives to improve pedestrian and traffic safety; and

WHEREAS, The National Roadway Safety Strategy highlights how roadway design and other infrastructure factors play a significant role in managing speeds and can deter excessive speeding behaviors from occurring in the first place by designing roads and streets to be "self-enforcing" to offer drivers contextual encouragement -- via lane width, intersection design, pedestrian and bicyclist infrastructure, and other features -- to drive at safer, slower speeds; and

WHEREAS, Many local and national transportation- and income equity-focused organizations advocate for an equitable, effective traffic safety approach that reduces reliance on enforcement through financial penalties by investing in street design, engineering, and infrastructure and to treat automated traffic enforcement as a temporary tool used only as part of a comprehensive street design and infrastructure improvement plan; and

WHEREAS, The Fines and Fees Justice Center recommends addressing income inequities in traffic enforcement by prioritizing non-financial sanctions and developing graduated responses based on the frequency and severity of the behavior in extreme cases; and

WHEREAS, The Fines and Fees Justice Center recommends employing ability-to-pay assessments, designating any revenue generated by automated traffic enforcement systems to discretionary and one-time expenses, removing sanctions for an inability to pay a fine, and ending the practice of adding fees, surcharges, penalties, or interest to fines if financial sanctions are employed; and

WHEREAS, California has employed an online option, "MyCitations", to allow people to look up their citation, answer a series of questions, and submit a request for a possible reduction in the amount owed and/or request a payment plan, more time to pay, or a community service option, saving the public and the courts significant time and resources while increasing overall payment compliance; and
WHEREAS, In 2018, Chicago’s Fines, Fees, and Access Collaborative under the Office of the City Clerk reviewed the City’s fines, fees, and collection practices and their impact on residents and provided fourteen recommendations for reform to increase compliance, evaluate existing practices, improve access and awareness, and build equity and sustainability; and

WHEREAS, In 2022, Chicago launched its Clear Path Relief pilot program to assist low-income motorists with existing vehicle-related debt and introduced Fix-It Defense for an expired City sticker or expired license plate ticket violation, and the City made the program permanent in 2023; now, therefore,

Be It Resolved, That we, the members of the City Council of the City of Chicago, do hereby call for the Traffic Compliance Administrator to establish an interagency working group that includes, but is not limited to, representatives from the Office of Equity and Racial Justice, the Department of Finance, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Administrative Hearings, the Office of Budget and Management, the Office of the City Clerk, and relevant community organizations for the purposes of assessing Chicago’s vehicle-related enforcement structure and practices and designing a more equitable enforcement system, including fines and fees reform; and

Be It Further Resolved, That such working group shall convene its first meeting no later than 60 days after the passage of this resolution and deliver its recommendations, including any proposed legislation or rules, to the Committee on Pedestrian and Traffic Safety by August 1, 2025.

MISCELLANEOUS BUSINESS.
