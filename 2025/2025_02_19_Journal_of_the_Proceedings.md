Rules Suspended -- CELEBRATION OF BLACK HISTORY MONTH.

[R2025-0015538]

The Honorable Brandon Johnson, Mayor, presented the following communication:

OFFICE OF THE MAYOR
CITY OF CHICAGO

February 19, 2025.

To the Honorable, The City Council of the City of Chicago:

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- I transmit herewith, together with Aldermen Ervin, Fuentes, Coleman, Martin, Dowell, Mosley, Hadden, Lee, Cruz, Gardiner, Chico, Moore, Gutierrez, Clay, Yancy, Conway, Waguespack, Lopez, Robinson, Villegas, Taylor, Taliaferro, Vasquez, Manaa-Hoppenworth, Nugent, Harris, Ramirez-Rosa, Sigcho-Lopez and City Clerk Valencia, a resolution honoring Black History Month.
Your favorable consideration of this resolution will be appreciated.

Very truly yours,

(Signed) BRANDON JOHNSON,
Mayor.

Alderperson Mitchell moved to Suspend the Rules Temporarily to permit immediate consideration of and action upon the said proposed resolution. The motion Prevailed.

The following is said proposed resolution:

WHEREAS, February is Black History Month, an annual celebration of the many achievements by African Americans and their central role in the history of the United States; and

WHEREAS, The origin of Black History Month began in 1915, half a century after the 13th Amendment abolished slavery in the United States, and grew out of "Negro History Week", the creation of noted historian Carter G. Woodson and other prominent African Americans; and

WHEREAS, President Gerald Ford officially recognized Black History Month in 1976, calling upon the public to "seize the opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of Black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history"; and

WHEREAS, African Americans suffered enslavement and subsequently faced the injustices of lynch mobs, segregation, and denial of the basic and fundamental rights of citizenship; and

WHEREAS, The vestiges of those injustices and inequalities remain evident in the communities of the United States in 2025; and

WHEREAS, As a result of slavery, segregation, systemic racism and mass incarceration, the Black family has often been fractured, but not broken, as the love within communities has extended the familial bonds to support the family through oppression and other hard times; and

WHEREAS, The United States could have never achieved the greatness that it has achieved were it not for all the contributions that African Americans have made throughout its history; and

WHEREAS, With the Civil Rights Movement and a growing awareness of Black identity, Black History Month or National African American History Month evolved to an annual
celebration of achievements of Black Americans and a time for recognizing the central role of African Americans in U.S. history; and

WHEREAS, Black History Month provides Chicagoans with an opportunity to reflect on our shared history as Americans and honor the contributions and sacrifices of Black Americans who have helped shape our nation; and

WHEREAS, Our very own neighbors, friends, and constituents contribute to deepening the richness and the landscape of Black history every day in our communities; and

WHEREAS, We recognize that we must continually recommit ourselves to the task of education, to see history not only through our own eyes, but through the eyes of those who experienced the world differently than we experience it and appreciate the struggles for the betterment of self, family, and community that so many have suffered for, strived for, worked for, and sacrificed for; now, therefore,

Be It Resolved, That we, the Mayor and the members of the City Council of the City of Chicago, assembled this 19th day of February 2025, do hereby celebrate Black History Month, and encourage all Chicagoans to join in the celebration.

On motion of Alderperson Mitchell, seconded by Alderpersons Coleman, Hadden, Rodriguez, Sigcho-Lopez, Mitts, La Spata and Burnett, the foregoing resolution was Adopted by yeas and nays as follows:

Yeas -- Alderpersons La Spata, Hopkins, Dowell, Robinson, Yancy, Hall, Mitchell, Harris, Beale, Chico, Lee, Ramirez, Quinn, Gutierrez, Lopez, Coleman, Moore, Curtis, O'Shea, Taylor, Mosley, Rodriguez, Tabares, Scott, Sigcho-Lopez, Fuentes, Burnett, Ervin, Taliaferro, Cruz, Cardona, Waguespack, Rodriguez-Sanchez, Conway, Ramirez-Rosa, Villegas, Mitts, Sposato, Nugent, Vasquez, Napolitano, Reilly, Knudsen, Lawson, Gardiner, Clay, Martin, Manaa-Hoppenworth, Hadden, Silverstein -- 50.

Nays -- None.

Alderperson Mitchell moved to reconsider the foregoing vote. The motion was lost.

At this point in the proceedings, the Honorable Brandon Johnson, Mayor, joined the members of the City Council in commemorating February as Black History Month. Expressing his gratitude to stand in solidarity with all Chicagoans as we celebrate this incredible month and the importance of democracy as viewed through the lens of Black liberation, Mayor Johnson spoke of the founding of our city by Jean Baptiste Point DuSable and how Chicago has been shaped since that moment by the achievements and contributions of our Black community. While we strive to celebrate and uplift our Black residents every day, Black History Month presents the opportunity to honor and celebrate the sacrifices and contributions of those that have come before us, the Mayor stated, and encourages us to continue our fight for equality, civil rights, and justice. "Time and again, we have witnessed
the resilience of Black Americans as we work to overcome the barriers that stood before us”,
the Mayor stated, and observed that through slavery, segregation, systemic racism,
disparities, and mass incarceration, Black people continue to love, support, and uplift one
another as well as other communities fighting for their rights. “Now more than ever, we must
continue to come together to fight back against those who are trying to divide us”, the Mayor
asserted, and cautioned that we not succumb to fear mongering or other tactics such as the
removal of DEI programs in an effort to restrict Black representation from political leadership.
“Our city is what it is today because of our diversity” the Mayor stated, and encouraged all
Chicagoans to continue to fight for what is right, and ensure equality and inclusion, not only
in our Black community but for each and every person that calls Chicago home.

The Honorable Brandon Johnson, Mayor, presented the following communication:

OFFICE OF THE MAYOR
CITY OF CHICAGO

February 19, 2025.

To the Honorable, The City Council of the City of Chicago:

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- I transmit herewith, together with Aldermen Ervin, Fuentes,
Coleman, Martin, Dowell, Mosley, Hadden, Rodríguez-Sánchez, Lawson, La Spata,
Rodríguez, Taliaferro, Vasquez, Manaa-Hoppenworth, Lee, Cruz, Chico, Moore, Gutiérrez,
Clay, Yancy, Conway, Lopez, Robinson, Villegas, Taylor, Nugent, Harris, Sigcho-Lopez,
Ramirez-Rosa and City Clerk Valencia, a resolution recognizing National Reparations
Awareness Day.

Your favorable consideration of this resolution will be appreciated.

Very truly yours,

(Signed) BRANDON JOHNSON,
Mayor.
Alderperson Mitchell moved to *Suspend the Rules Temporarily* to permit immediate consideration of and action upon the said proposed resolution. The motion *Prevailed*.

The following is said proposed resolution:

WHEREAS, Black History Month highlights the rich history and contributions of Black individuals in the City of Chicago and beyond; and

WHEREAS, The Conrad Worrill Community Reparations Commission (CWCRC) and the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America (N’COBRA) partner annually on National Reparations Awareness Day (02/25) to foster education and dialogue about reparations as a tool for justice and repair; and

WHEREAS, N’COBRA, established in 1987, is a national coalition dedicated to educating, mobilizing and advocating for reparations for African descendants in the United States. In the 1990s, N’COBRA inaugurated National Reparations Awareness Day on February 25th to collectively highlight historic injustices such as the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre and to unify efforts in the fight for reparations, using this day to build awareness and galvanize public support; and

WHEREAS, reparations have been utilized in the United States as a form of redress for historical and systemic injustices, including but not limited to:

-- Japanese Americans who were forcibly relocated and incarcerated during World War II and who received formal apologies and financial restitution under the Civil Liberties Act of 1988;

-- Native American tribes, who have received settlements for land seizures and treaty violations, such as the 1946 establishment of the Indian Claims Commission;

-- Jewish Holocaust survivors, who were supported by U.S. government initiatives to recover and return assets and provide restitution;

-- Descendants of the Rosewood Massacre in Florida (1923), where survivors received financial reparations under state legislation passed in 1994; and

WHEREAS, Chicago made history in 2015 by establishing a $5.5 Million reparations package for survivors of police torture under former CPD Commander Jon Burge, marking the first municipal reparations program in the U.S. to address racially motivated law enforcement abuse; and
WHEREAS, Evanston, Illinois became the first U.S. city to implement a reparations program for Black residents in 2021, allocating $10 Million in cannabis sales tax revenue to fund initiatives addressing historical housing discrimination, including $25,000 grants for eligible Black residents to assist with home purchases, mortgage payments, and home repairs; and

WHEREAS, Systemic inequities persist today in the form of disparities in health, employment, homeownership, and life expectancy, with a notable 11.4-year life expectancy gap between Black and non-Black Chicagoans; and

WHEREAS, National Reparations Awareness Day also aims to promote a positive narrative by showcasing the resilience, creativity, and contributions of Black Americans to society through curated exhibits, educational workshops, and storytelling sessions; and

WHEREAS, The National Reparations Awareness Day serves as a platform for utilizing cultural achievements, including screenings of films highlighting historical narratives and reparative themes, as well as live performances of spoken word poetry, theater and musical tributes; and

WHEREAS, Fine arts programs, including visual art exhibits, community murals and interactive installations are organized to inspire dialogue and healing while honoring reparation artistry and cultural expression; and

WHEREAS, Educational activities, such as guided tours of historic landmarks, expert panel discussions, and community-led forums, provide opportunities to learn about the systemic harms inflicted upon Black communities and the ongoing efforts to address them; and

WHEREAS, National Reparations Awareness Day also serves as a platform to educate the public about the components of reparations -- Compensation, Restitution, Rehabilitation, Satisfaction and Guarantees of Non-Repetition -- and to inspire collective action for justice; now, therefore,

Be It Resolved, That we, the Mayor and the members of the City Council of the City of Chicago, assembled this 19th day of February 2025, do hereby celebrate Black History Month, and encourage all Chicagoans to join in the celebration; and

Be It Further Resolved, That we, the Mayor and members of the City of Chicago City Council, assembled this 19th day of February 2025, do hereby recognize February 25th as National Reparations Awareness Day and commit to using this day to educate our community on Chicago's history of systemic harm, amplify the voices of those affected, and advance reparations as a path toward justice and equity for Black residents.
On motion of Alderperson Mitchell, seconded by Alderpersons Coleman, Hadden, Rodriguez, Sigcho-Lopez, Mitts, La Spata and Burnett, the foregoing resolution was Adopted by yeas and nays as follows:

Yeas -- Alderpersons La Spata, Hopkins, Dowell, Robinson, Yancy, Hall, Mitchell, Harris, Beale, Chico, Lee, Ramirez, Quinn, Gutiérrez, Lopez, Coleman, Moore, Curtis, O'Shea, Taylor, Mosley, Rodríguez, Tabares, Scott, Sigcho-Lopez, Fuentes, Burnett, Ervin, Taliaferro, Cruz, Cardona, Waguespack, Rodríguez-Sánchez, Conway, Ramirez-Rosa, Villegas, Mitts, Sposato, Nugent, Vasquez, Napolitano, Reilly, Knudsen, Lawson, Gardiner, Clay, Martin, Manaa-Hoppenworth, Hadden, Silverstein -- 50.

Nays -- None.

Alderperson Mitchell moved to reconsider the foregoing vote. The motion was lost.

At this point in the proceedings, the Honorable Brandon Johnson, Mayor, joined the members of the City Council in recognizing February 25th as National Reparations Awareness Day. As we honor and recognize the past and celebrate the achievements we are making today we must also acknowledge and continue to fight to address the historical and systemic injustices of the past and present, the Mayor stated, and educate the public about the importance of reparations and how they can inspire collective action for true economic justice. As Chicago continues its nearly 20-year long struggle for reparations we must remember that restitution and restoration cannot be secured through government alone, the Mayor observed, but accountability must also be shared by corporations who have benefitted from slavery. Reflecting on the racial injustices and inequities facing Black communities both in the United States and abroad, Mayor Johnson stated that “it’s incumbent upon us to lead the way as Chicagoans and Black Chicagoans” and to continue our efforts to raise awareness and support for Black reparations not only in America, but for countries throughout the world.

WHEREAS, Mr. Huggins helped found Riteway-Huggins Construction, Inc. in 1975 as Riteway Painting and Decorating, Inc.; and

WHEREAS, In 1985, after a decade of success with Riteway Painting and Decorating Inc., he recognized the opportunity to expand his business and reorganized as a general contracting firm; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Huggins' business acumen, leadership and drive in forming Riteway Construction was a bold move that paid off as the company began winning major
contracts at O'Hare airport, construction manager contract for the Democratic National Convention at the United Center, McCormick Place expansion contract and numerous other projects; and

WHEREAS, In 1981, Mr. Huggins received the annual Bronze Hard Hat Award from the Chicago Economic Development Corporation in recognition of the firm's achievements, performance and growth as a minority-owned construction firm; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Huggins was a founding member of Black Contractors United, which continues to support and pave the way for African Americans in the construction industry and in 1997 he became the first African American to sit on the board of Chicago's commuter rail system, Metra; and

On motion of Alderperson Mitchell, seconded by Alderpersons Harris, Moore, Villegas, Lee, Curtis, Hall, Dowell, Robinson, Sposato, Burnett, Hadden, O'Shea, Hopkins, Ervin, Mosley, Taliaferro, Coleman, Lopez and Mitts, the foregoing resolution was Adopted by yeas and nays as follows:

At this point in the proceedings, the Honorable Brandon Johnson, Mayor, joined the members of the City Council in recognizing Larry Huggins for his accomplishments and contributions to the City of Chicago. Proclaiming Mr. Huggins as an indelible part of our city's history, Mayor Johnson spoke of his success story as an accomplished businessman and founder of Riteway-Huggins Construction, a founding member of Black Contractors United, as well as an incredible philanthropist. As Chief Executive Officer, president, and founder of Riteway-Huggins, the company was an integral part in some of our city's landmark projects, the Mayor stated, including the O'Hare International Airport expansion, the McCormick Place expansion, and leading as a construction manager for the Democratic National Convention. Growing up in the Englewood neighborhood of Chicago in the 1960s, there were not many opportunities for young Black men to be entrepreneurs let alone leaders in their industry, the Mayor stated, but Mr. Huggins persevered with hard work, determination and entrepreneurship to provide leadership and industry to our city. Mr. Huggins' service goes beyond helping to build our city, the Mayor asserted, and as a philanthropist and business leader he has helped support and sponsor programs and initiatives to assist minority-owned businesses, provide educational opportunities for our city's Black students and host charitable and community events such as "Christmas in the Wards." Lauding Larry Huggins for his leadership and commitment to and impact on our city and expressing gratitude for his inspirational example for young Black men, Mayor Johnson conveyed his best wishes for continued success and happiness.

City Council Informed As To Miscellaneous Documents Filed In City Clerk's Office.

The Honorable Andrea M. Valencia, City Clerk, informed the City Council that documents have been filed in her office relating to the respective subjects designated as follows:

Placed On File -- DESIGNATION OF CENTURY BUILDING AT 202 S. STATE ST. AS CHICAGO LANDMARK

A communication from Giere Boatright, Commissioner, Department of Planning and Development, under the date of February 4, 2025, received in the Office of the City Clerk on February 10, 2025, regarding the automatic granting of landmark designation for the Century Building at 202 South State Street (02024-0007258) pursuant to ordinance and Section 2-120-705 of the Municipal Code of Chicago and effective as of January 22, 2025, which was Placed on File.

Said ordinance referred to in the aforementioned communication reads as follows:

WHEREAS, Pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Municipal Code of Chicago (the "Municipal Code"), Sections 2-120-620 through -690, the Commission on Chicago Landmarks (the "Commission") has determined that the Century Building (the "Building"), located at 202 South State Street, Chicago, Illinois, and legally described in Exhibit 1, attached hereto, satisfies three (3) criteria for landmark designation as set forth in Section 2-120-620 (1), (4) and (5) of the Municipal Code; and

WHEREAS, The Building is an outstanding example of a distinct retail building type known as a "tall shops" building. "Tall shops" buildings were the retail equivalent of the speculative office building, using high-rise structures to create interior shopping "streets". Free from the vagaries of outside weather, noise, and bustle, this early vertical version of an indoor mall allowed shoppers to move from one floor to the next as they perused goods and services; and

WHEREAS, "Tall shops" buildings like the Building were designed to attract the large numbers of small- and mid-sized merchants and service providers who desired the advantages of being located on State Street but for whom street-level space did not make economic sense. Handsome edifices with lavish entries and lobbies were designed to attract and encourage potential customers to enter and circulate through the building. Elegant display cases on the ground floor allowed upper-floor tenants to advertise their wares. On the upper floors, glass corridor walls of the tenant spaces functioned like shop windows. Tenants enjoyed the advantages of single ownership in terms of scale of operation and building management while amenities such as restaurants doubled as a draw for potential customers; and
WHEREAS, The Building is prominently sited at the southwest corner of State and Adams Streets. Despite occupying only about half of the State Street frontage in the Loop, speculative high-rise "tall shops" and professional office buildings, typically occupying corners, along with major department store buildings, occupying half- or full-block lots, visually dominated the streetscape and created a distinctive street wall with canyon-like views; and

WHEREAS, The Building manifests in built form the increasing demand for retail space on State Street and the consequent skyrocketing prices for it in the decades before the First World War. Developers exploited advances in building technologies and materials to construct taller buildings by creating skyscrapers on the highly desirable but often narrow parcels they were able to assemble. These purpose-built retail "tall shops" structures contributed to the increasing density of State Street over the course of its evolution as Chicago's primary retail corridor; and

WHEREAS, The Building is a Commercial-style building in the tradition of the Chicago School of architecture. Experiments with building materials and technologies allowed buildings to grow taller, exterior walls to open up to allow in more light, and usable interior space to be maximized with fewer columns. The Building utilized these key elements of the Chicago School of architecture; and

WHEREAS, The Building is located on State Street in Chicago's Loop, home to more buildings from the Chicago School of architecture than anywhere else. The Building represents the final years of this movement, generally considered to end with the onset of the First World War, where emphasis on expression of the steel-frame construction gave way to emphasis on the verticality and sleek, linear geometry seen in much of the following decades' skyscrapers; and

WHEREAS, The Building was one of dozens of Loop structures built in the two decades leading up to the First World War featuring white-glazed-terra-cotta cladding. Taken together, they represented the most extensive use of white-glazed terra cotta in the city; and

WHEREAS, Although the Building employs the steel frame, large window openings, and white-glazed terra cotta that characterized Holabird & Roche's State Street commercial buildings since 1900, it also signaled a change. The repeating, narrow, continuous mullions within each bay, the overall height of the structure relative to its width, and the darkening and recessing of spandrel panels so they visually recede relative to the verticals give the facades a striking emphasis on verticality. This new emphasis was central to skyscraper designs of the following decades by Holabird and Roche and its successor firm, Holabird and Root; and

WHEREAS, The Building displays a high level of detailing and craftsmanship in the Late Gothic terra-cotta ornamentation at the Building's exterior; and
WHEREAS, The 1951 -- 1952 remodeling of the Building's exterior at the first and second floors by architect William Sevic for Home Federal Savings reflects the optimism and prosperity of post-war America when new was equated with better. Like other financial institutions of the era, appearing modern and efficient was seen as a way to attract customers. The unadorned, smooth lines of the International Style were used to communicate this message; and

WHEREAS, The wholesale change of storefronts, indeed even entire facades, has been a continuous phenomenon from State Street's earliest days. With the recovery of the economy after the Second World War, modernization of commercial spaces accelerated on State Street. The Building's altered exterior at the first and second floors is especially noteworthy as a rare surviving example of a mid-twentieth-century commercial storefront remodeling on State Street; and

WHEREAS, The storefront of the Building is an excellent example of the translation of the International Style to storefront design. New, "open front" storefronts prioritized views inside such that the interior commercial space became the display. Tall, plate-glass windows were employed as both window and architectural form. The Building's dramatic, floor-to-ceiling, curving-plate-glass storefront trimmed in stainless steel is an example par excellence of these ideas; and

WHEREAS, The Building was designed by Chicago architects William Holabird and Martin Roche, both of whom are recognized as innovative and prolific practitioners of the Chicago School of architecture; and

WHEREAS, The architectural firm of Holabird & Roche was one of the most successful and prolific architectural firms in Chicago between 1883 and 1927. By the time the Building was completed in 1916, the firm was responsible for five to ten percent of the construction in the city. Over a dozen of their buildings are designated as individual Chicago Landmarks including the Old Colony, Marquette, Chicago, and City Hall-County Buildings, the Three Arts Club, and the Palmer House Hotel; and

WHEREAS, Holabird & Roche was one of the firms whose work played a large role in shaping State Street. The Building was one in a series of their steel-frame, white-glazed-terra-cotta buildings for which they became known, including the twelve-story Republic Building (1905, demolished 1961; 209 South State Street), the nineteen-story North American Building (1912, extant; 2 West Monroe Street), the Rothschild Department Store (1912, extant; 333 South State Street), and the Waterman Building (1919, extant; 127 South State Street); and

WHEREAS, Consistent with Section 2-120-630 of the Municipal Code, the Building has a significant historic, community, architectural, or aesthetic interest or value, the integrity of which is preserved in light of its location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, and ability to express such historic, community, architectural, or aesthetic interest or value; and
WHEREAS, On December 7, 2023, the Commission adopted a resolution recommending to the City Council of the City of Chicago (the “City Council”) that the Building be designated a Chicago Landmark; now, therefore,

Be It Ordained by the City Council of the City of Chicago:

SECTION 1. The above recitals are hereby adopted as the findings of the City Council.

SECTION 2. The Building is hereby designated a Chicago Landmark in accordance with Section 2-120-700 of the Municipal Code.

SECTION 3. For purposes of Sections 2-120-740 and 2-120-770 of the Municipal Code governing permit review, the significant historical and architectural features of the Building are identified as:

-- All exterior elevations of the Building, including rooflines and the first- and second-floor exteriors remodeled in 1951 -- 1952.

In light of the Building’s adjacency to the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse and the security vulnerabilities asserted by the federal government, and in order to recognize and provide the flexibility which may be needed to accommodate the fifteen (15) reuse criteria provided by the General Services Administration for the Building which were developed in collaboration with the United States District Court, Northern District of Illinois, and federal law enforcement agencies, and published in the November 1, 2022, Federal Register, the following additional guidelines shall also apply to the Commission’s review of permits pursuant to Section 2-120-740:

-- The Commission shall have flexibility to allow modifications to the Building to accommodate the GSA’s reuse criteria in order that viable reuse of the Building can be achieved.

SECTION 4. The Commission is hereby directed to create a suitable plaque appropriately identifying the Building as a Chicago Landmark.

SECTION 5. If any provision of this ordinance shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect any of the other provisions of this ordinance.

SECTION 6. All ordinances, resolutions, motions, or orders in conflict with this ordinance are hereby repealed to the extent of such conflict.

SECTION 7. This ordinance shall take effect upon the date of its passage and approval.

Exhibit 1 referred to in this ordinance reads as follows:

Placed On File -- DESIGNATION OF CONSUMERS BUILDING AT 220 S. STATE ST. AS CHICAGO LANDMARK.

A communication from Ciere Boatright, Commissioner, Department of Planning and Development, under the date of February 4, 2025, received in the Office of the City Clerk on February 10, 2025, regarding the automatic granting of landmark designation for the Consumers Building at 220 South State Street (02024-0007259) pursuant to ordinance and Section 2-120-705 of the Municipal Code of Chicago and effective as of January 22, 2025, which was Placed on File.

Said ordinance referred to in the aforementioned communication reads as follows:

WHEREAS, Pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Municipal Code of Chicago (the "Municipal Code"), Sections 2-120-620 through 690, the Commission on Chicago Landmarks (the "Commission") has determined that the Consumers Building (the "Building"), located at 220 South State Street, Chicago, Illinois, and legally described in Exhibit 1, attached hereto, satisfies three (3) criteria for landmark designation as set forth in Section 2-120-620 (1), (4), and (5) of the Municipal Code; and
WHEREAS, The Building is an excellent example of a professional office building from the early twentieth century. These high-rise office buildings, typically located on corners and reaching between fifteen (15) and twenty-five (25) stories, had retail on the lower floors and leasable office space on the upper floors. These typically tall, narrow structures, like the Building, offered abundant light and ventilation provided by plentiful fenestration, allowed for subdivision to suit tenant needs, and had exteriors and building entries meant to be attractive to potential customers; and

WHEREAS, The Building, completed in 1916, is a professional office building, a distinct building type important to the evolution of State Street which reflects the symbiotic relationship between retail and professional services seen throughout State Street's history as Chicago's primary retail thoroughfare; and

WHEREAS, Despite occupying only about half of the frontage along State Street, "skyscraper" professional office buildings and similar "tall shops" buildings, typically occupying corners, along with major department store buildings occupying half-or full-block lots, visually dominated the streetscape of State Street and created a distinctive street wall with canyon-like views; and

WHEREAS, As a professional office building commissioned by speculative real estate developer Jacob L. Kesner, the Building reflects the market forces at work on State Street which led to greater specialization of building use. Developers began to construct "purpose-built" structures tailored to intended uses such as professional office buildings; and

WHEREAS, The Building manifests in built form the increasing demand for retail and office space and the consequent skyrocketing prices for State Street real estate taking place in the decades before the First World War which left developers with no choice but to build upward. Developers exploited advances in building technologies and materials to construct taller buildings by creating skyscrapers on the highly desirable but often narrow parcels they were able to assemble. These buildings were part of the evolution of State Street during its retail dominance of Chicago and the resulting compactness and density of the business and retail corridor; and

WHEREAS, The Building is a Commercial-style building in the tradition of the Chicago School of architecture. Experiments with building materials and technologies allowed buildings to grow taller, exterior walls to open up to allow in more light, and usable interior space to be maximized with fewer columns. The Building utilized these key elements of the Chicago School of architecture; and

WHEREAS, Commercial-style buildings emphasize the clear expression of the steel-frame structure. The Building's steel frame is expressed on the exterior by the grid-like pattern of continuous, vertical piers, and narrow, horizontal spandrels. The overall height of the structure relative to its width, the widening of piers at the corners and center of the east elevation, and the recessing of spandrel panels emphasize the vertical over the horizontal elements of the facade; and
WHEREAS, The Building is located on State Street in Chicago’s Loop, home to more buildings from the Chicago School of architecture than anywhere else. The Building represents the final years of this movement, generally considered to end with the onset of the First World War; and

WHEREAS, The Building was one of dozens of Loop structures built in the two decades leading up to the First World War featuring white-glazed-terra-cotta cladding. Taken together, they represented the most extensive use of white-glazed terra cotta in the city; and

WHEREAS, The Building displays a high level of detailing and craftsmanship in the Classical Revival terra-cotta ornamentation at the building’s exterior; and

WHEREAS, The Building’s vestibule and lobby are especially noteworthy as a rare surviving example of an early twentieth-century professional office building entryway and lobby in Chicago. The walls and ceilings are clad in white Carrara marble with simple geometric Classical Revival detailing and a marble staircase is set into an alcove. Crossbeams in the vestibule and lobby ceiling align with pilasters along the walls. Decorative bronze elements include door frames and lobby fixtures like baseboard grills, a building directory, mailbox, elevator detailing, and festooned sconces at each pilaster; and

WHEREAS, The Building was one of many Loop structures designed by the architectural firm of Mundie & Jensen including the Municipal Courts Building (1906 and 1912 addition, extant, 116 South Michigan Avenue, located in the Chicago Landmark Historic Michigan Avenue District), the Kesner Building (1910, extant, 1 -- 5 North Wabash Avenue), the LeMoyne Building (1915, extant, 180 North Wabash Avenue), the Singer Building (1925 --1926, extant, 120 South State Street) and the Union League Club (1926, extant, 65 West Jackson Boulevard); and

WHEREAS, Mundie & Jensen were among the most important designers in the city enlisted by auto dealers in the first decades of the twentieth century to construct new showrooms in the automobile sales and service nexus of Motor Row located south of the Loop. Six of the firm’s buildings are extant and located within the Chicago Landmark Motor Row District; and

WHEREAS, During its three decades (1907 --1936), Mundie & Jensen was one of the most prolific architectural firms in Chicago after the turn of the twentieth century. They were known not only for their Loop skyscrapers, but for their industrial, bank, and residential buildings; and

WHEREAS, Architect Elmer C. Jensen’s sense of responsibility to the larger profession of architecture earned him the title “Dean of Chicago Architects” and he was “given about every honor members of his profession in Chicago have been able to bestow” according to a Chicago Tribune biographical profile. His list of membership organizations and positions held is lengthy and, upon his death in 1955, he had spent nearly seventy (70) years in the field of architecture; and
WHEREAS, Architect William Bryce Mundie distinguished himself by the quality of his
draftsmanship and designs while working for William Le Baron Jenney and rose to become
a partner in 1891, forming Jenney & Mundie. Mundie is credited with the design of the
Horticultural Building erected for the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition. He served as
Architect for the Chicago Board of Education from 1898 to 1904 and became a Fellow of
the American Institute of Architects; and

WHEREAS, Consistent with Section 2-120-630 of the Municipal Code, the Building has a
significant historic, community, architectural, or aesthetic interest or value, the integrity of
which is preserved in light of its location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, and ability
to express such historic, community, architectural, or aesthetic interest or value; and

WHEREAS, On December 7, 2023, the Commission adopted a resolution recommending
to the City Council of the City of Chicago (the “City Council”) that the Building be designated
a Chicago Landmark; now, therefore,

Be It Ordained by the City Council of the City of Chicago:

SECTION 1. The above recitals are hereby adopted as the findings of the City Council.

SECTION 2. The Building is hereby designated a Chicago Landmark in accordance with
Section 2-120-700 of the Municipal Code.

SECTION 3. For purposes of Sections 2-120-740 and 2-120-770 of the Municipal Code
governing permit review, the significant historical and architectural features of the Building
are identified as:

-- All exterior elevations, including rooflines, of the Building; and

-- The main entrance vestibule and elevator lobby.

In light of the Building’s adjacency to the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse and the security
vulnerabilities asserted by the federal government, and in order to recognize and provide
the flexibility which may be needed to accommodate the fifteen (15) reuse criteria
provided by the General Services Administration (the “GSA”) for the Building which were
developed in collaboration with the United States District Court, Northern District of
Illinois, and federal law enforcement agencies, and published in the November 1, 2022,

The Construction Contract, and each contract between the General Contractor and any subcontractor, shall contain a provision to this effect and also shall contain a provision requiring compliance with the policies and procedures outlined in the ATS Manual. An approved Change Order shall not be deemed to imply any obligation on the part of the City to increase the amount of City Funds which the City has pledged pursuant to this Agreement or provide any other additional assistance to the Owner.

3.05 DPD Approval. Any approval granted by DPD of the Scope Drawings, Plans and Specifications and the Change Orders is for the purposes of this Agreement only and does not affect or constitute any approval required by any other City department or pursuant to any City
ordinance, code, regulation or any other governmental approval, nor does any approval by DPD pursuant to this Agreement constitute approval of the quality, structural soundness or safety of the Property or the Project.

3.06 Other Approvals. Any DPD approval under this Agreement shall have no effect upon, nor shall it operate as a waiver of, Developer's obligations to comply with the provisions of Section 5.03 (Other Governmental Approvals). Developer shall not start construction of the Project until Developer has obtained all necessary permits and approvals (including but not limited to DPD's approval of the Scope Drawings and Plans and Specifications) and proof of the General Contractor's and each subcontractor's bonding as required under this Agreement.

3.07 Progress Reports and Survey Updates. If requested by DPD, Developer shall provide DPD with written progress reports detailing the status of the Project, including a revised completion date, if necessary (with any change in completion date being considered a Change Order, requiring DPD's written approval pursuant to Section 3.04). Written progress reports must be submitted to DPD electronically to the website and/or email specified by the City. Developer shall provide an updated Survey to DPD if requested by DPD or any lender providing Lender Financing, reflecting improvements made to the Property.

3.08 Inspecting Agent or Architect. An independent agent or architect shall be selected to act as the inspecting agent or architect, at Developer's expense, for the Project, and DPD reserves the right to evaluate and approve the inspecting agent or architect. The inspecting agent or architect shall perform periodic inspections with respect to the Project, providing certifications with respect to these inspections to DPD, before Developer requests disbursement for costs related to the Project under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, if any. If approved by the City, the inspecting agent or architect may be the Developer's architect or the same one being used in such role by a lender providing Lender Financing, provided that such agent or architect acknowledges in writing to the City that the City may rely on the findings of such agent or architect.

3.09 Barricades. Before starting any construction requiring barricades, Developer shall install a construction barricade of a type and appearance satisfactory to the City and constructed in compliance with all applicable federal, state or City laws, ordinances, and regulations. DPD retains the right to approve the maintenance, appearance, color scheme, painting, nature, type, content, and design of all barricades.

3.10 Signs and Public Relations. Developer shall erect a sign of size and style approved by the City in a conspicuous location on the Property during the Project, indicating that financing has been provided by the City. The City reserves the right to include the name, photograph, artistic rendering of the Project and other pertinent information regarding Developer, the Property and the Project in the City's promotional literature and communications.

3.11 Utility Connections. Developer may connect all on-site water, sanitary, storm and sewer lines constructed on the Property to City utility lines existing on or near the perimeter of the Property, provided Developer first complies with all City requirements governing such connections, including the payment of customary fees and costs related to such connections.

3.12 Permit Fees. In connection with the Project, Developer shall be obligated to pay only those building, permit, engineering, tap on and inspection fees that are assessed on a
uniform basis throughout the City of Chicago and are of general applicability to other property within the City of Chicago.

*Excluding costs for TIF-Funded Improvements previously paid or reimbursed by the City.
Notwithstanding the schedule set forth above, if at any Milestone other than the issuance of the Certificate there is a Shortfall, the Developer may provide a Requisition Form with required supporting documentation for the amount of TIF-Funded Improvements incurred by the Developer at the time of such Milestone followed by one supplemental Requisition Form with required supporting documentation when the Developer has incurred TIF-Funded Improvements in the Shortfall Amount and is eligible to receive payment of such Shortfall Amount.

4.04 Requisition Form. Developer shall provide DPD with a Requisition Form for reimbursement of TIF-Funded improvements, along with the documentation described in the Requisition Form or otherwise requested by DPD. Developer shall meet with DPD at the request of DPD to discuss any Requisition Form previously delivered.

4.05 Treatment of Prior Expenditures and Subsequent Disbursements.

(a) Effect of Prior Expenditures on Equity or Lender Financing demonstrated before the Closing Date. If Developer incurs and pays Project expenses before the Closing Date and wants these expenses to reduce the amount of Equity or Lender Financing Developer is required to demonstrate before the Closing Date, then Developer shall provide documentation of these expenses satisfactory to DPD. Any such expenses reviewed and approved in writing by DPD, in its sole discretion, shall be referred to as "Prior Expenditures". Prior Expenditures made for TIF-Funded Improvements may be reimbursed to Developer under the terms of this Agreement. Prior Expenditures made for items other than TIF-Funded Improvements shall not be reimbursed to Developer but shall reduce the amount of Equity and/or Lender Financing Developer is required to contribute under Section 4.01.

(b) TIF District Administration Fee. Annually, the City may allocate an amount (the "TIF District Administration Fee") not to exceed five percent (5%) of the Incremental Taxes to pay costs the City incurred to administer and monitor the Redevelopment Area, including the Project. Such fee shall be in addition to and shall not be deducted from or considered a part of the City Funds, and the City shall have the right to receive such funds before any City Funds are paid under this Agreement.

(c) Allocation Among Line Items. Disbursements for expenditures related to TIF-Funded Improvements may be allocated to and charged against the appropriate line only, with transfers of costs and expenses from one line item to another, without the prior written consent of DPD, being prohibited; provided, however, that such transfers among line items, in an amount not to exceed $50,000 or $250,000 in the aggregate, may be made without the prior written consent of DPD.

4.06 Cost Overruns. If the aggregate cost of the TIF-Funded Improvements exceeds City Funds available pursuant to Section 4.03, or if the cost of completing the Project exceeds the Project Budget, Developer shall be solely responsible for such excess cost, and shall hold the City harmless from any and all costs and expenses of completing the TIF-Funded Improvements in excess of City Funds and of completing the Project.

4.07 Preconditions of Disbursement. Before each disbursement of City Funds, Developer shall submit documentation regarding the applicable expenditures to DPD, which shall be satisfactory to DPD in its sole discretion. Developer's delivery of any request for disbursement of
City Funds shall, in addition to the items expressly set forth in such request, constitute Developer's certification to the City, as of the date of such request for disbursement, that:

(a) the total amount of the disbursement request represents the actual cost of the acquisition of the Property or the actual amount payable to (or paid to) the General Contractor and/or subcontractors who have performed work on the Project, and/or their payees;

(b) all amounts shown as previous payments on the current disbursement request have been paid to the parties entitled to such payment;

(c) Developer has approved all work and materials for the current disbursement request and such work and materials conform to the Plans and Specifications;

(d) the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement are true and correct and Developer is in compliance with all covenants contained in this Agreement;

(e) Developer has received no notice and has no knowledge of any liens or claim of lien either filed or threatened against the Property except for the Permitted Liens;

(f) no Event of Default or condition or event which, with the giving of notice or passage of time or both, would constitute an Event of Default exists or has occurred; and

(g) the Project is In Balance. The Project shall be deemed to be in balance ("In Balance") only if the total of the Available Project Funds equals or exceeds the aggregate of the amount necessary to pay all unpaid Project costs incurred or to be incurred in the completion of the Project. Developer hereby agrees that, if the Project is not In Balance, Developer shall, within 10 days after a written request by the City, deposit with the escrow agent or will make available (in a manner acceptable to the City), cash in an amount that will place the Project In Balance, which deposit shall first be exhausted before any further disbursement of the City Funds shall be made.

The City shall have the right, in its discretion, to require Developer to submit further documentation as the City may require in order to verify that the matters certified to above are true and correct, and any disbursement by the City shall be subject to the City's review and approval of such documentation and its satisfaction that such certifications are true and correct; provided, however, that nothing in this sentence shall be deemed to prevent the City from relying on such certifications by Developer. In addition, Developer shall have satisfied all other preconditions of disbursement of City Funds for each disbursement, including but not limited to requirements set forth in the TIF Ordinances, this Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreement.

4.08 Conditional Grant. The City Funds are being granted on a conditional basis, subject to Developer's compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, and are subject to being reimbursed as provided in Section 15.02.

After the Certificate is issued, however, all executory terms and conditions of this Agreement and all representations and covenants contained in this Agreement will continue to remain in full force and effect throughout the Term of the Agreement as to the parties described in the following paragraph, and the issuance of the Certificate shall not be

(b) the right (but not the obligation) to complete those TIF-Funded Improvements that are public improvements and to pay for the costs of TIF-Funded Improvements (including interest costs) out of City Funds or other City monies. If the aggregate cost of completing the TIF-Funded Improvements exceeds the amount of City Funds available pursuant to Section 4.03, Developer shall reimburse the City for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the City in completing such TIF-Funded Improvements in excess of the available City Funds; and

(c) the right to place a lien on the Project in the amount of City Funds paid and/or to seek reimbursement of the City Funds from Developer.

SECTION 8. COVENANTS/REPRESENTATIONS/WARRANTIES OF DEVELOPER.

8.01 General. The representations and warranties provided by Developer under this Agreement are material conditions precedent to the City's obligations under this Agreement. Developer represents, warrants, and covenants, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the date of each disbursement of City Funds hereunder and throughout the Term of the Agreement, that:

Developer agrees to report the number of jobs, whether FTE or otherwise, to date created by the Project. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the failure to create the specified number of Jobs shall not constitute an Event of Default.

Except for the Permitted Liens, Developer agrees to pay or cause to be paid when due any Non-Governmental Charge assessed or imposed upon the Project, the Property or any fixtures that are or may become attached thereto, which creates, may create, or appears to create a lien upon all or any portion of the Property or Project; provided however, that if such Non-Governmental Charge may be paid in installments, Developer may pay the same together with any accrued interest thereon in installments as they become due and before any fine, penalty, interest, or cost may be added thereto for nonpayment. Developer shall furnish to DPD, within thirty (30) days of DPD's request, official receipts from the appropriate entity, or other proof satisfactory to DPD, evidencing payment of the Non-Governmental Charge in question.

(b) Right to Contest. Developer has the right, before any delinquency occurs:

(i) to contest or object in good faith to the amount or validity of any Non-Governmental Charge by appropriate legal proceedings properly and diligently instituted and prosecuted, in such manner as shall stay the collection of the contested Non-Governmental Charge, prevent the imposition of a lien or remove such lien, or prevent the sale or forfeiture of the Property (so long as no such contest or objection shall be deemed or construed to relieve, modify or extend Developer's covenants to pay any such Non-Governmental Charge at the time and in the manner provided in this Section 8.15); or

(ii) at DPD's sole option, to furnish a good and sufficient bond or other security satisfactory to DPD in such form and amounts as DPD shall require, or a good and sufficient undertaking as may be required or permitted by law to accomplish a stay of any such sale or forfeiture of the Property or any portion thereof or any fixtures that are or may be attached thereto, during the pendency of such contest, adequate to pay fully any such contested Non-Governmental Charge and all interest and penalties upon the adverse determination of such contest.

8.19 Real Estate Provisions.

(a) Governmental Charges.

(i) Payment of Governmental Charges. Developer agrees to pay or cause to be paid when due all Governmental Charges (as defined below) which are assessed or imposed upon Developer, the Property or the Project, or become due and payable, and which create or may create a lien upon Developer or all or any portion of the Property or the Project. "Governmental Charge" means all federal, State, county, the City, or other governmental (or any instrumentality, division, agency, body, or department thereof) taxes, levies, assessments, charges, liens, claims or encumbrances (except for those assessed by foreign nations, states other than the State of Illinois, counties of the State other than Cook County, and municipalities other than the City) relating to Developer, the Property or the Project including but not limited to real estate taxes.

(ii) Right to Contest. Developer has the right before any delinquency occurs to contest or object in good faith to the amount or validity of any Governmental Charge by appropriate legal proceedings properly and diligently instituted and prosecuted in such manner as shall stay the collection of the contested Governmental Charge and prevent the imposition of a lien or the sale or forfeiture of the Property. Developer's right to challenge real estate taxes applicable to the Property is limited as provided for in Section 8.19(c) below; provided, that such real estate taxes must be paid in full when due and may be disputed only after such payment is made. No such contest or objection shall be deemed or construed in any way as relieving, modifying, or extending Developer's covenants to pay any such Governmental Charge at the time and in the manner provided in this Agreement unless Developer has given prior written notice to DPD of Developer's intent to contest or object to a Governmental Charge and, unless, at DPD's sole option,

(x) Developer shall demonstrate to DPD's satisfaction that legal proceedings instituted by Developer contesting or objecting to a Governmental Charge shall conclusively operate to prevent or remove a lien against, or the sale or forfeiture of, all or any part of the Property to satisfy such Governmental Charge before the final determination of such proceedings; and/or

(y) Developer shall furnish a good and sufficient bond or other security satisfactory to DPD in such form and amounts as DPD shall require, or a good and sufficient undertaking as may be required or permitted by law to accomplish a stay of any such sale or forfeiture of the Property during the pendency of such contest, adequate to pay fully any such contested Governmental Charge and all interest and penalties upon the adverse determination of such contest.

(b) Developer's Failure To Pay Or Discharge Lien. If Developer fails to pay any Governmental Charge or to obtain discharge of the same, then Developer shall advise DPD in writing. At that time DPD in its sole discretion may, but shall not be obligated to, make all or any part of such payment or obtain such discharge and take any other related action which DPD deems advisable. By taking any action under this paragraph, DPD shall not waive or release any obligation or liability of Developer under this Agreement. Developer shall promptly reimburse DPD for all sums, if any, DPD pays under this paragraph and expenses, if any, including reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, expenses and other charges relating thereto. Notwithstanding anything contained in this paragraph to the contrary, this paragraph shall not be construed to
obligate the City to pay any Governmental Charge. If Developer fails to pay any Governmental Charge, the City, in its sole discretion, may require Developer to submit to the City audited Financial Statements at Developer's own expense.

(c) Intentionally omitted.

(d) Notification to the Cook County Assessor of Change in Use or Ownership. If required under 35 ILCS 200/15-20 due to a change in use or ownership of the Property, within 90 days after the Closing Date, Developer shall complete a letter of notification, in accordance with 35 ILCS 200/15-20, notifying the Cook County Assessor of such change in use or ownership. After delivery of the notification, Developer shall forward a copy of the return receipt to DPD, with a copy to the City's Corporation Counsel's office.

8.21 Inspector General. It is the duty of Developer and the duty of any bidder, proposer, contractor, subcontractor, and every applicant for certification of eligibility for a City contract or program, and all of Developer's officers, directors, agents, partners, and employees and any such bidder, proposer, contractor, subcontractor or such applicant, to cooperate with the Inspector General in any investigation or hearing undertaken pursuant to Chapter 2-56 of the Municipal Code. Developer represents that it understands and will abide by all provisions of Chapter 2-56 of the Municipal Code and that it will inform subcontractors of this provision and require their compliance.

8.22 Sustainable Development Policy. Developer shall provide evidence acceptable to the City that it has complied with the Sustainable Development Policy for the Project in accordance with Section 7.01. If a default occurs under this Section 8.22, the City shall have the right to reduce the City Funds by $250,000 as described in Section 15.02.

8.23. FOIA and Local Records Act Compliance.

(a) FOIA. Developer acknowledges that the City is subject to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act, 5 ILCS 140/1 et. seq., as amended ("FOIA"). The FOIA requires the City to produce records (very broadly defined in FOIA) in response to a FOIA request in a very short period of time, unless the records requested are exempt under the FOIA. If Developer receives a request from the City to produce records within the scope of FOIA, then Developer covenants to comply with such request within 48 hours of the date of such request. Failure by Developer to timely comply with such request shall be an Event of Default.

(b) Exempt Information. Documents that Developer submits to the City as part of the Annual Compliance Report or otherwise during the Term of the Agreement that contain trade secrets and commercial or financial information may be exempt if disclosure would result in competitive harm. However, for documents submitted by Developer to be treated as a trade secret or information that would cause competitive harm, FOIA requires that Developer mark any such documents as "proprietary, privileged or confidential." If Developer marks a document as "proprietary, privileged and confidential", then DPD will evaluate whether such document may be
withheld under the FOIA. DPD, in its discretion, will determine whether a document will be exempted from disclosure, and that determination is subject to review by the Illinois Attorney General's Office and/or the courts.

(c) Local Records Act. Developer acknowledges that the City is subject to the Local Records Act, 50 ILCS 205/1 et. seq, as amended (the "Local Records Act"). The Local Records Act provides that public records may only be disposed of as provided in the Local Records Act. If requested by the City, Developer covenants to use its best efforts consistently applied to assist the City in its compliance with the Local Records Act.

8.24 Survival of Covenants. All warranties, representations, covenants and agreements of Developer contained in this Section 8 and elsewhere in this Agreement shall be true, accurate and complete at the time of Developer's execution of this Agreement, and shall survive the execution, delivery and acceptance hereof by the parties to this Agreement and, except as provided in Section 7 when the Certificate is issued, shall be in effect throughout the Term of the Agreement.

8.25 Increment and Rate of Return Reporting. Developer agrees to report the increment projected to be created by the Project at the Closing Date. Developer agrees to report the increment to date created by the Project. Developer agrees to report the Project's rate of return. Rate of return report to be independently verified by a third party chosen by the City.

9.01 General Covenants. The City represents that it has the authority as a home rule unit of local government to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

9.02 Survival of Covenants. All warranties, representations, and covenants of the City contained in this Section 9 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be true, accurate, and complete at the time of the City's execution of this Agreement, and shall survive the execution, delivery and acceptance hereof by the parties to this Agreement and be in effect throughout the Term of the Agreement.

SECTION 10. DEVELOPER'S EMPLOYMENT OBLIGATIONS

10.01 Employment Opportunity. Developer, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, hereby agrees, and shall contractually obligate its or their various contractors, subcontractors or any Affiliate of Developer operating on the Property (collectively, with Developer, the "Employers" and individually an "Employer") to agree, that for the Term of this Agreement with respect to Developer and during the period of any other party's provision of services in connection with the construction of the Project or occupation of the Property:

(a) No Employer shall discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment based upon race, religion, color, sex, national origin or ancestry, age, handicap or disability, sexual orientation, military discharge status, marital status, parental status or source of income as defined in the City of Chicago Human Rights Ordinance, Chapter 2-160, Section 2-160-010 et seq., Municipal Code, except as otherwise provided by said ordinance and as amended from time to time (the "Human Rights Ordinance"). Each Employer shall take affirmative action to ensure
that applicants are hired and employed without discrimination based upon race, religion, color, sex, national origin or ancestry, age, handicap or disability, sexual orientation, military discharge status, marital status, parental status or source of income and are treated in a non-discriminatory manner with regard to all job-related matters, including without limitation: employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training, including apprenticeship. Each Employer agrees to post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for employment, notices to be provided by the City setting forth the provisions of this nondiscrimination clause. In addition, the Employers, in all solicitations or advertisements for employees, shall state that all qualified applicants shall receive consideration for employment without discrimination based upon race, religion, color, sex, national origin or ancestry, age, handicap or disability, sexual orientation, military discharge status, marital status, parental status or source of income.

(b) To the greatest extent feasible, each Employer is required to present opportunities for training and employment of low- and moderate-income residents of the City and preferably of the Redevelopment Area; and to provide that contracts for work in connection with the construction of the Project be awarded to business concerns that are located in, or owned in substantial part by persons residing in, the City and preferably in the Redevelopment Area.

(c) Each Employer shall comply with all federal, state and local equal employment and affirmative action statutes, rules and regulations, including but not limited to the City's Human Rights Ordinance and the Illinois Human Rights Act, 775 ILCS 5/1-101 et seq. (1993), and any subsequent amendments and regulations promulgated thereto.

(d) Each Employer, in order to demonstrate compliance with the terms of this Section, shall cooperate with and promptly and accurately respond to inquiries by the City, which has the responsibility to observe and report compliance with equal employment opportunity regulations of federal, state and municipal agencies.

(e) Each Employer shall include the foregoing provisions of subparagraphs (a) through (d) in every contract entered into in connection with the Project, and shall require inclusion of these provisions in every subcontract entered into by any subcontractors, and every agreement with any Affiliate operating on the Property, so that each such provision shall be binding upon each contractor, subcontractor or Affiliate, as the case may be.

(f) Failure to comply with the employment obligations described in this Section 10.01 shall be a basis for the City to pursue remedies under the provisions of Section 15.02.

10.02 City Resident Construction Worker Employment Requirement. Developer agrees for itself and its successors and assigns, and shall contractually obligate its General Contractor and shall cause the General Contractor to contractually obligate its subcontractors, as applicable, to agree, that during the construction of the Project they shall comply with the minimum percentage of total worker hours performed by actual residents of the City as specified in Section 2-92-330 of the Municipal Code (at least 50 percent of the total worker hours worked by persons on the site of the Project shall be performed by actual residents of the City): provided, however, that in addition to complying with this percentage, Developer, its General Contractor and each subcontractor shall be required to make good faith efforts to utilize qualified residents of the City in both unskilled and skilled labor positions.
Developer may request a reduction or waiver of this minimum percentage level of Chicagoans as provided for in Section 2-92-330 of the Municipal Code in accordance with standards and procedures developed by the Chief Procurement Officer of the City.

"Actual residents of the City" means persons domiciled within the City. The domicile is an individual's one and only true, fixed and permanent home and principal establishment.

Developer, the General Contractor and each subcontractor shall provide for the maintenance of adequate employee residency records to show that actual Chicago residents are employed on the Project. Each Employer shall maintain copies of personal documents supportive of every Chicago employee's actual record of residence.

Weekly certified payroll reports (U.S. Department of Labor Form WH-347 or equivalent) shall be submitted to the Commissioner of DPD in triplicate, which shall identify clearly the actual residence of every employee on each submitted certified payroll. The first time that an employee's name appears on a payroll, the date that the Employer hired the employee should be written in after the employee's name.

Developer, the General Contractor and each subcontractor shall provide full access to their employment records to the Chief Procurement Officer, the Commissioner of DPD, the Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department, the Inspector General or any duly authorized representative of any of them. Developer, the General Contractor and each subcontractor shall maintain all relevant personnel data and records for a period of at least three (3) years after final acceptance of the work constituting the Project.

At the direction of DPD, affidavits and other supporting documentation will be required of Developer, the General Contractor and each subcontractor to verify or clarify an employee's actual address when doubt or lack of clarity has arisen.

Good faith efforts on the part of Developer, the General Contractor and each subcontractor to provide utilization of actual Chicago residents (but not sufficient for the granting of a waiver request as provided for in the standards and procedures developed by the Chief Procurement Officer) shall not suffice to replace the actual, verified achievement of the requirements of this Section concerning the worker hours performed by actual Chicago residents.

When work at the Project is completed, in the event that the City has determined that Developer has failed to ensure the fulfillment of the requirement of this Section concerning the worker hours performed by actual Chicago residents or failed to report in the manner as indicated above, the City will thereby be damaged in the failure to provide the benefit of demonstrable employment to Chicagoans to the degree stipulated in this Section. Therefore, in such a case of non-compliance, it is agreed that 1/20 of 1 percent (0.0005) of the aggregate hard construction costs set forth in the Project budget (the product of .0005 x such aggregate hard construction costs) (as the same shall be evidenced by approved contract value for the actual contracts) shall be surrendered by Developer to the City in payment for each percentage of shortfall toward the stipulated residency requirement. Failure to report the residency of employees entirely and correctly shall result in the surrender of the entire liquidated damages as if no Chicago residents were employed in either of the categories. The willful falsification of statements and the certification of payroll data may subject Developer, the General Contractor and/or the subcontractors to prosecution. Any retainage to cover contract performance that may become
due to Developer pursuant to Section 2-92-250 of the Municipal Code may be withheld by the City pending the Chief Procurement Officer's determination as to whether Developer must surrender damages as provided in this paragraph.

Nothing herein provided shall be construed to be a limitation upon the "Notice of Requirements for Affirmative Action to Ensure Equal Employment Opportunity, Executive Order 11246" and "Standard Federal Equal Employment Opportunity, Executive Order 11246," or other affirmative action required for equal opportunity under the provisions of this Agreement or related documents.

Developer shall cause or require the provisions of this Section 10.02 to be included in all construction contracts and subcontracts related to the Project.

10.03. MBE/WBE Commitment. Developer agrees for itself and its successors and assigns, and, if necessary to meet the requirements set forth herein, shall contractually obligate the General Contractor to agree that during the Project:

(a) Consistent with the findings which support, as applicable, (i) the Minority-Owned and Women-Owned Business Enterprise Procurement Program, Section 2-92-420 et seq., Municipal Code (the "Procurement Program"), and (ii) the Minority- and Women-Owned Business Enterprise Construction Program, Section 2-92-650 et seq., Municipal Code (the "Construction Program," and collectively with the Procurement Program, the "MBE/WBE Program"), and in reliance upon the provisions of the MBE/WBE Program to the extent contained in, and as qualified by, the provisions of this Section 10.03, during the course of the Project, at least the following percentages of the MBE/WBE Budget (as set forth in Exhibit B) shall be expended for contract participation by MBEs and by WBEs:

1. At least 26 percent by MBEs.
2. At least six percent by WBEs.

(b) For purposes of this Section 10.03 only, Developer (and any party to whom a contract is let by Developer in connection with the Project) shall be deemed a "contractor" and this Agreement (and any contract let by Developer in connection with the Project) shall be deemed a "contract" or a "construction contract" as such terms are defined in Sections 2-92-420 and 2-92-670, Municipal Code, as applicable.

(c) Consistent with Sections 2-92-440 and 2-92-720, Municipal Code, Developer's MBE/WBE commitment may be achieved in part by Developer's status as an MBE or WBE (but only to the extent of any actual work performed on the Project by Developer) or by a joint venture with one or more MBEs or WBEs (but only to the extent of the lesser of (i) the MBE or WBE participation in such joint venture or (ii) the amount of any actual work performed on the Project by the MBE or WBE), by Developer utilizing a MBE or a WBE as the General Contractor (but only to the extent of any actual work performed on the Project by the General Contractor), by subcontracting or causing the General Contractor to subcontract a portion of the Project to one or more MBEs or WBEs, or by the purchase of materials or services used in the Project from one or more MBEs or WBEs, or by any combination of the foregoing. Those entities which constitute both a MBE and a WBE shall not be credited more than once with regard to Developer's MBE/WBE commitment as described in this Section 10.03. In accordance with Section 2-92-730,
Municipal Code, Developer shall not substitute any MBE or WBE General Contractor or subcontractor without the prior written approval of DPD.

Upon the occurrence of any such Event of Default, in addition to any other remedies provided in this Agreement, the City may: (1) issue a written demand to Developer to halt the Project, (2) withhold any further payment of any City Funds to Developer or the General Contractor, or (3) seek any other remedies against Developer available at law or in equity.
SECTION 11. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

The Developer provided the City with a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment ("Phase I ESA") compliant with ASTM E-1527-21 for the Property prior to and conducted, or updated, within 180 days prior to the conveyance of the Property and a Phase II Environmental Site Assessment ("Phase II ESA").

The Phase I ESA identified Recognized Environmental Conditions ("RECs") and the Developer performed a Phase II ESA to ascertain the presence of any environmental impacts that may be associated with the RECs.

The Phase II ESA identified contamination above residential remediation objectives as determined by Title 35 of the Illinois Administrative Code ("IAC") Part 742, and the Developer shall enroll the Property (or any portion thereof) in the IEPA's SRP in order to obtain a Final Comprehensive Residential NFR Letter for the enrolled Property. The Developer acknowledges and agrees that it may not commence construction on the Property or commence any other activity on the Property that could interfere with the prompt start and completion of the RAP until the IEPA issues a RAP Approval Letter for the Property.

Upon receipt of the RAP Approval Letter for the Property, the Developer covenants and agrees to promptly complete all Remediation Work necessary to obtain a Final Comprehensive Residential NFR Letter for the Property using all reasonable means. The City shall have the right to review in advance and approve all documents submitted to the IEPA under the SRP, as amended or supplemented from time to time, including, without limitation, the SRP Documents and any changes thereto, and the Developer's estimate of the cost to perform the Remediation Work. The Developer shall bear sole responsibility for all costs of the Remediation Work necessary to obtain the Final Comprehensive Residential NFR Letter, and the costs of any other investigative and cleanup costs associated with the Property. The Developer shall promptly transmit to the City copies of all Environmental Documents prepared or received with respect to the Remediation Work, including, without limitation, any written communications delivered to or received from the IEPA or other regulatory agencies. The Developer acknowledges and agrees to not request a certificate of occupancy for the Project from the City's Department of Buildings until the IEPA has issued, and the Developer has recorded with the Cook County Clerk's Office and the City has approved, a Final Comprehensive Residential NFR Letter for the Property (to the extent required), which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the Developer fails to obtain the Final Comprehensive Residential NFR Letter within six (6) months of the submission of the RACR to the IEPA, unless the City agreed to extend such time period, then the City shall have the right to issue a notice of default of this Agreement against the Property.

The Developer shall remove any soil or soil gas not meeting the requirements of 35 IAC Section 742.305. Any underground storage tanks ("USTs") identified must be removed and closed in accordance with applicable regulations including Title 41 of IAC Part 175 and any identified leaking USTs must be properly addressed in accordance with 35 IAC Part 734.

The Developer shall cooperate and consult with the City at all relevant times (and in all cases upon the City's request) with respect to environmental matters. 2FM shall have the right to review and approve the sufficiency of the Phase I ESA and Phase II ESA (if needed). The City must be named in a reliance letter for all environmental assessment reports produced concerning the Property.
The Developer must abide by the terms and conditions of the Final Comprehensive Residential NFR Letter.

Developer will conduct a Hazardous Building Material Survey of the Property prior to conducting any work that could constitute renovation, demolition, or abatement under the Environmental Laws ("abatement work") on or within an existing physical structure located on the Property. The Hazardous Building Material Survey shall include (but is not limited to):

- asbestos and lead-based paint surveys,
- testing and visually inspecting and, as necessary, testing the Property to determine the presence and location of polychlorinated-biphenyl (PCB)-containing equipment and materials (such as lighting ballasts, switchgears, transformers, and hydraulic fluids),
- mercury-containing equipment and materials (mercury lamps, thermostats, switches, thermometers, regulators, and gauges),
- radioactive material-containing equipment and/or waste,
- medical wastes (such as biological or infectious wastes, hazardous chemicals, and/or wastes),
- refrigerants such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs),
- large appliances or equipment,
- mold,
- or any other materials that may require special handling or disposal during or after renovation, demolition, or abatement work.

The Hazardous Building Material Survey must discuss each of the Hazardous Building Materials listed above and state whether or not they were identified. The Hazardous Building Material Survey must document the type, location, quantity, and condition of each Hazardous Building Material that is identified.

Any Hazardous Building Materials that will be impacted by renovation or demolition activities, or are in poor or unstable condition, must be properly abated. A report documenting the Hazardous Building Material Survey results and an abatement plan shall be submitted to the City for review prior to beginning any renovation, demolition, or abatement work. Please note that abatement does not necessarily require removal and disposal of materials. Alternative methods to stabilize or prevent access to materials may be utilized if appropriate.

The Developer will incorporate the results of the Hazardous Building Material Survey into its Project documents and perform abatement work as part of the Project in accordance with all Environmental Laws. A report documenting the completion of the abatement work shall be submitted to the City prior to approval of the Property for occupancy. If abatement work activities are not deemed sufficient by the City, the Developer shall continue work at their own expense until approved.

Developer acknowledges that, except in the case of information specifically designated by the Developer to be treated confidentially as a trade secret or secret process, the City may make environmental assessments, hazardous material building surveys, IEPA SRP submittals, or similar environmental documents relating to the property publicly available, and Developer consents to the City's publication of those documents.
The Developer, on behalf of itself and its officers, directors, employees, successors, assigns and anyone claiming by, through or under them (collectively, the "Developer Parties"), hereby releases, relinquishes and forever discharges the City, its officers, agents and employees (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties"), from and against any and all Losses which the Developer or any of the Developer Parties ever had, now have, or hereafter may have, whether grounded in tort or contract or otherwise, in any and all courts or other forums, of whatever kind or nature, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, now existing or occurring after the Closing Date, based upon, arising out of or in any way connected with, directly or indirectly (i) any environmental contamination, pollution or hazards associated with the Property or any improvements, facilities or operations located or formerly located thereon, including, without limitation, any release, emission, discharge, generation, transportation, treatment, storage or disposal of Hazardous Substances (ii) the structural, physical or environmental condition of the Property, including, without limitation, the presence or suspected presence of Hazardous Substances or Other Regulated Material in, on, under or about the Property or the migration of Hazardous Substances or Other Regulated Material from or to other Property; (iii) any violation of, compliance with, enforcement of or liability under any Environmental Laws, including, without limitation, any governmental or regulatory body response costs, natural resource damages or Losses arising under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. § 6901 et seq; and (iv) any investigation, cleanup, monitoring, remedial, removal or restoration work required by any federal, state or local governmental agency or political subdivision or other third party in connection or associated with the Property or any improvements, facilities or operations located or formerly located thereon (collectively, "Released Claims"). Furthermore, the Developer shall indemnify, defend (through an attorney reasonably acceptable to the City) and hold the Indemnified Parties harmless from and against any and all Losses which may be made or asserted by any third parties (including, without limitation, any of the Developer Parties) arising out of or in any way connected with, directly or indirectly, any of the Released Claims. The Developer Parties waive their rights of contribution and subrogation against the Indemnified Parties.

All mortgages or deeds of trust in place as of the date of this Agreement with respect to the Property or any portion thereof that were made before or on the date of this Agreement in connection with Lender Financing and which are Permitted Liens are referred to in this Agreement as the “Existing Mortgages.” Any mortgage or deed of trust that Developer may hereafter elect to execute and record or permit to be recorded against the Property or any portion thereof is referred to in this Agreement as a “New Mortgage.” Any New Mortgage that Developer may hereafter elect to execute and record or permit to be recorded against the Property or any portion thereof with the prior written consent of the City is referred to in this Agreement as a “Permitted Mortgage.” The City and Developer agree as follows:

(a) If a mortgagee or any other party shall succeed to Developer’s interest in the Property or any portion thereof pursuant to the exercise of remedies under a New Mortgage (other than a Permitted Mortgage), whether by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure, and in conjunction therewith accepts an assignment of Developer’s interest under this Agreement in accordance with Section 18.14 (Assignment), the City may, but shall not be obligated to, attorn to and recognize such party as the successor in interest to Developer for all purposes under this Agreement and, unless so recognized by the City as the successor in interest, such party shall be entitled to no rights or benefits under this Agreement, but such party shall be bound by those provisions of this Agreement that are covenants expressly running with the land.

(b) If any mortgagee shall succeed to Developer’s interest in the Property or any portion thereof pursuant to the exercise of remedies under an Existing Mortgage or a Permitted Mortgage, whether by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure, and in conjunction therewith accepts an assignment of Developer’s interest under this Agreement in accordance with Section 18.14 (Assignment), the City hereby agrees to attorn to and recognize such party as the successor in interest to Developer for all purposes under this Agreement so long as such party accepts all of the obligations and liabilities of “Developer” under this Agreement; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, it is understood and agreed that if such party accepts an assignment of Developer’s interest under this Agreement, such party has no liability under this Agreement for any Event of Default of Developer which accrued before such party succeeded to the interest of Developer under this Agreement, in which case Developer shall be solely responsible. However, if such mortgagee under a Permitted Mortgage or an Existing Mortgage does not expressly accept an assignment of Developer’s interest under this Agreement, such party shall be entitled to no rights and benefits under this Agreement, and such
party shall be bound only by those provisions of this Agreement, if any, which are covenants expressly running with the land.

(c) Before the City issues a Certificate under Section 7, Developer shall not execute a New Mortgage with respect to the Property or any portion of the Property without the prior written consent of the Commissioner of DPD.

or character of the Project or any activities undertaken by Developer affecting the Project site, the Project, or both, or increases any time agreed for performance by Developer by more than ninety (90) days.

No delay or omission on the part of a party in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver of such right or any other right unless pursuant to the specific terms of this Agreement. A waiver by a party of a provision of this Agreement shall not prejudice or constitute a waiver of such party's right otherwise to demand strict compliance with that provision or any other provision of this Agreement. No prior waiver by a party, nor any course of dealing between the parties to this Agreement, shall constitute a waiver of any such parties' rights or of any obligations of any other party to this Agreement as to any future transactions.

18.06 Remedies Cumulative. The remedies of a party under this Agreement are cumulative and the exercise of any one or more of the remedies provided for in this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any other remedies of such party unless specifically so provided in this Agreement.

18.08 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.

18.09 Severability. If any provision in this Agreement, or any paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase, word or the application thereof, in any circumstance, is held invalid, this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid part were never included in this Agreement and the remainder of this Agreement shall be and remain valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.
18.10 **Conflict.** In the event of a conflict between any provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of the TIF Ordinances, such ordinance(s) shall prevail and control.

The Commissioner or other person designated by the Mayor of the City shall act for the City or DPD in making all approvals, consents, and determinations of satisfaction, granting the Certificate or otherwise administering this Agreement for the City.

18.14 **Assignment.** Developer may not sell, assign, or otherwise transfer its interest in this Agreement in whole or in part without the written consent of the City.

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Agreement shall not run to the benefit of, or be enforceable by, any person or entity other than a party to this Agreement and its successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement should not be deemed to confer upon third parties any remedy, claim, right of reimbursement or other right.

18.16 **Force Majeure.** Neither the City nor Developer nor any successor in interest to either of them shall be considered in breach of or in default of its obligations under this Agreement in the event of any delay caused by damage or destruction by fire or other casualty, strike, shortage of material, unusually adverse weather conditions such as, by way of illustration and not limitation, severe rain storms or below freezing temperatures of abnormal degree or for an abnormal duration, tornadoes or cyclones, and other events or conditions beyond the reasonable control of the party affected which in fact interferes with the ability of such party to discharge its obligations under this Agreement. The individual or entity relying on this section with respect to any such delay shall, upon the occurrence of the event causing such delay, immediately give written notice to the other parties to this Agreement.

Developer also will pay any court costs, in addition to all other sums provided by law.

18.20 **Business Relationships.** Developer acknowledges (A) receipt of a copy of Section 2-156-030 (b) of the Municipal Code, (B) that Developer has read such provision and understands that pursuant to such Section 2-156-030 (b), it is illegal for any elected official of the City, or any person acting at the direction of such official, to contact, either orally or in writing, any other City official or employee with respect to any matter involving any person with whom the elected City official or employee has a business relationship that creates a "Financial Interest" (as defined in Section 2-156-010 of the Municipal Code)(a "Financial Interest"), or to participate in any discussion in any City Council committee hearing or in any City Council meeting or to vote on any matter involving any person with whom the elected City official or employee has a business relationship that creates a Financial Interest, or to participate in any discussion in any City Council committee hearing or in any City Council meeting or to vote on any matter involving the person with whom an elected official has a business relationship that creates a Financial Interest, and (C) that a violation of Section 2-156-030 (b) by an elected official, or any person acting at the direction of such official, with respect to any transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall be grounds for termination of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

WHEREAS, By virtue of Section 6(a) of Article VII of the 1970 Constitution of the State of Illinois (the "Constitution"), the City of Chicago (the "City") is a home rule unit of government and as such may exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and

WHEREAS, As a home rule unit and pursuant to the Constitution, the City is authorized and empowered to issue multi-family housing revenue obligations for the purpose of financing the cost of the acquisition, construction, rehabilitation, development, and equipping of an affordable multi-family housing facility for low- and moderate-income families located in the City ("Multi-Family Housing Financing"); and

WHEREAS, The Humboldt Park United Methodist Church, Inc., an Illinois not-for-profit corporation (the "HPUMC Corporation"), was the prior owner of the real property located at 2120 -- 2128 North Mozart Street, Chicago, Illinois 60647, as identified on Exhibit E attached hereto (the "Property"); and

WHEREAS, The HPUMC Corporation sold the Property to LUCHA SPE Holdings LLC, an Illinois limited liability company ("LUCHA SPE"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Latin United Community Housing Association, an Illinois not-for-profit corporation ("LUCHA"), and LUCHA SPE will then sell the Property to HPUMC Redevelopment Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited partnership (the "Borrower"); and

WHEREAS, The Borrower, 2120 Mozart LLC, an Illinois limited liability company (the "General Partner"), the general partner of the Borrower, and LUCHA, the sole member of the General Partner, have proposed to purchase the Property in the manner described above, for the renovation and adaptive reuse of the existing Humboldt Park United Methodist Church, being the construction, furnishing and equipping of a low-income housing project consisting of a three-story apartment building that will contain 22 rental dwelling units, comprised of eight studios, eight one-bedroom apartments, three two-bedroom apartments and three three-bedroom apartments, with five apartments expected to be set aside as permanent supportive housing units (including related common areas, the "Project"); and

WHEREAS, The General Partner will have a 0.01 percent partnership interest in the Borrower and an entity acceptable to the Authorized DOH Officer (as defined below) (the "Investor Partner"), will have a 99.99 percent partnership interest in the Borrower; and

WHEREAS, By this ordinance (this "Ordinance"), the City Council of the City (the "City Council") has determined that it is necessary and in the best interests of the City to provide Multi-Family Housing Financing and certain other funding, as provided herein, to the Borrower, to enable it to: (i) pay; or (ii) reimburse itself for a portion of the costs of the Project, and to pay a portion of the costs of issuance of the Multi-Family Housing Financing and other costs incurred in connection therewith; and

(the "Bank"), pursuant to which the City will borrow an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) (the "Funding Loan") for the purposes set forth above and, in evidence of its limited, special obligation to repay that borrowing, issue a tax-exempt revenue note, which is expected to be designated as Multi-Family Housing Revenue Note (LUCHA Humboldt Park Project), Series 2025 (the "Note"), under the terms and conditions of this Ordinance and the Funding Loan Agreement, and the City will thereafter loan the proceeds of the Funding Loan to the Borrower (the "Borrower Loan") pursuant to a borrower loan agreement (the "Borrower Loan Agreement") between the City and the Borrower, as evidenced by a certain Borrower promissory note (the "Borrower Note"), in order to finance a portion of the cost of the Project in return for loan payments sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, prepayment premium, if any, and interest on the Note; and

WHEREAS, The principal of, prepayment premium, if any, and interest payable on the Note will be secured solely by, among other things: (i) a construction mortgage on the Property; (ii) certain capital contributions to be made to the Borrower by the Investor Partner; (iii) federal low-income housing tax credits; (iv) Illinois donation tax credits; and (vi)* pledges and/or assignments of certain funds, personal property, and contractual rights of the Borrower and its affiliates (including certain Multi-Family Program Funds and CRP Funds, as defined below, and a Community Project Funding Grant from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development); and

WHEREAS, The Funding Loan and the Note and the obligation to pay interest thereon do not now and shall never constitute an indebtedness of or an obligation of the City, the State of Illinois or any political subdivision thereof, within the purview of any Constitutional limitation or statutory provision, or a charge against the general credit or taxing powers of any of them. No party to the Funding Loan Agreement or holder of the Note shall have the right to compel the taxing power of the City, the State of Illinois or any political subdivision thereof to pay any principal installment of, prepayment premium, if any, or interest on the Note or obligations under the Funding Loan Agreement; and

WHEREAS, The Borrower now desires to obtain financing from various sources including the Borrower Loan, the City Loan defined and described below and equity from the syndication of low-income housing tax credits ("LIHTCs") and Illinois Affordable Housing Tax Credits ("IAHTCs"), and various sources of additional funding, all such funding as shown in Exhibit A attached hereto (the LIHTCs, IAHTCs and other additional funding, collectively "Additional Financing"); and

WHEREAS, The City has certain funds available from a variety of funding sources ("Multi-Family Program Funds") and/or from Chicago Recovery Plan funds ("CRP Funds") to make loans and grants for the development of multi-family residential housing to increase the number of families served with decent, safe, sanitary and affordable housing and to expand the long-term supply of affordable housing, and such Multi-Family Program Funds and CRP Funds are administered by the Department of Housing ("DOH") of the City; and

WHEREAS, The City has preliminarily reviewed and approved the making of a loan or loans to the Borrower in an amount not to exceed $4,766,904, to be funded from its Multi-Family Program Funds and/or its CRP Funds (collectively, the "City Loan") pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in this Ordinance and Exhibit A attached hereto and made a part hereof; and

WHEREAS, The City has preliminarily reviewed and approved the making of a decarbonization grant to LUCHA from CRP Funds in an amount not to exceed $1,288,919 and a PSH grant to LUCHA from CRP Funds in an amount not to exceed $1,350,000 (collectively, the "City Grants"), which grants will be loaned or capitally contributed to the Borrower; and

WHEREAS, On January 16, 2002, the City Council adopted an ordinance published in the Journal of the Proceedings of the City Council of the City of Chicago (the "Journal") for such date at pages 77362 through 77366, inclusive, as amended by an ordinance adopted by the City Council on September 4, 2003 and published in the Journal for such date at pages 6475 through 6626, inclusive, which authorized the establishment of a program (as supplemented, amended and restated from time to time, the "Donation Tax Credit Program") to be implemented by DOH in connection with the use of certain tax credits authorized by the Illinois General Assembly pursuant to Public Act 92-0491 (as supplemented, amended and restated from time to time) for donations made in connection with affordable housing projects; and

WHEREAS, The conveyance of the Property by the HPUMC Corporation to LUCHA SPE in connection with the Project may qualify under the Donation Tax Credit Program as an eligible donation, and may generate certain additional proceeds for the Project, but the receipt of such donations and proceeds is not a condition to the making of the Borrower Loan; now, therefore,

Upon each advance of principal under the Borrower Loan Agreement and the Construction Funding Agreement, a like amount of the Funding Loan shall be deemed concurrently and simultaneously advanced under this Funding Loan Agreement, including the initial advance of $_____. Notwithstanding anything in this Funding Loan Agreement to the contrary, no additional amounts of the Funding Loan may be drawn down and funded hereunder after ________, 2028; provided, however, that upon the delivery of a Tax Counsel No Adverse Effect Opinion to the Governmental Lender and the Funding Lender such date may be changed to a later date as specified in such Tax Counsel No Adverse Effect Opinion.

The outstanding principal amount of the Governmental Lender Note and of the Funding Loan as of any given date shall be the total amount advanced by the Funding Lender to or for the account of the Governmental Lender to fund corresponding advances with respect to the Borrower Note under the Borrower Loan Agreement and the Construction Funding Agreement as proceeds of the Borrower Loan, less any payments of principal of the Governmental Lender Note previously received upon payment of corresponding principal amounts under the Borrower Note, including regularly scheduled principal payments and voluntary and mandatory prepayments. The principal amount of the Governmental Lender Note and interest thereon shall be payable on the basis specified in this paragraph (d) and in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this Section 2.1.

Section 8.6. **Tax Covenants.** The Governmental Lender covenants to and for the benefit of the Funding Lender and any other holders of an interest in the Governmental Lender Note that, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Funding Loan Agreement or of any other instrument, it will:

(ii) Not use or knowingly permit the use of any proceeds of the Funding Loan or other funds of the Governmental Lender, directly or indirectly, in any manner, and will not take or permit to be taken any other action or actions, which would result in any of the Governmental Lender Note being treated as an obligation not described in Section 142(a)(7) of the Code by reason of the Governmental Lender Note or interest thereon not meeting the requirements of Section 142(d) of the Code;

In furtherance of the covenants in this Section 8.6, the Governmental Lender and the Borrower shall execute, deliver and comply with the provisions of the Tax Compliance Agreement, which are by this reference incorporated into this Funding Loan Agreement and made a part of this Funding Loan Agreement as if set forth in this Funding Loan Agreement in full, and by its acceptance of this Funding Loan Agreement the Funding Lender acknowledges receipt of the Tax Compliance Agreement and acknowledges its incorporation in this Funding Loan Agreement by this reference.

For purposes of this Section 8.6 the Governmental Lender’s compliance shall be based solely on matters within the Governmental Lender’s control and no acts, omissions or directions of the Borrower, the Funding Lender or any other Persons shall be attributed to the Governmental Lender.

In complying with the foregoing covenants, the Governmental Lender and/or the Funding Lender may rely from time to time on a Tax Counsel No Adverse Effect Opinion or other appropriate opinion of Tax Counsel.

(b) The Governmental Lender will promptly notify the Borrower, the Servicer, the Equity Investor and the Funding Lender in writing of the occurrence of any Borrower Loan Agreement Default, provided that the Governmental Lender has received written notice or otherwise has actual knowledge of such event; and further provided that the Governmental Lender shall have no liability to any person for its failure to provide any such notice so long as it has made a good faith effort to comply with such provisions.

(c) The Funding Lender will promptly notify the Borrower, the Servicer, if any, the Equity Investor and the Governmental Lender in writing of the occurrence of any Event of Default hereunder or any Borrower Loan Agreement Default known to the Funding Lender.

(b) The Governmental Lender will at any and all times, upon the reasonable request of the Servicer, the Borrower or the Funding Lender, afford and procure a reasonable opportunity by their respective representatives to inspect the books, records, reports and other papers of the Governmental Lender relating to the Project and the Funding Loan, if any, and to make copies thereof.

Section 8.11. Representations and Warranties of the Funding Lender.

ARTICLE IX
DEFAULT; REMEDIES

Section 9.1. Events of Default. Any one or more of the following shall constitute an event of default (an "Event of Default") under this Funding Loan Agreement (whatever the reason for such event and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body):

(a) A default in the payment of any interest upon the Governmental Lender Note when such interest becomes due and payable; or

(b) A default in the payment of principal of, or premium on, the Governmental Lender Note when such principal or premium becomes due and payable, whether at its stated maturity, by declaration of acceleration or call for mandatory prepayment or otherwise; or
(c) Default in the performance or breach of any material covenant or warranty of the Governmental Lender in this Funding Loan Agreement (other than a covenant or warranty or default in the performance or breach of which is elsewhere in this Section specifically dealt with), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 30 days after there has been given written notice, as provided in Section 11.1 hereof, to the Governmental Lender and the Borrower by the Funding Lender or the Servicer, specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" under this Funding Loan Agreement; provided that, so long as the Governmental Lender, Borrower, or Equity Investor has commenced to cure such failure to observe or perform within the thirty (30) day cure period and the subject matter of the default is not capable of cure within said thirty (30) day period and the Governmental Lender, Borrower or Equity Investor is diligently pursuing such cure to the Funding Lender's satisfaction, with the Funding Lender's Written Direction or Written Consent, then the Governmental Lender shall have an additional period of time as reasonably necessary (not to exceed 30 days unless extended in writing by the Funding Lender) within which to cure such default; or

(d) A default in the payment of any Additional Borrower Payments; or

(e) Any other "Default" or "Event of Default" under any of the other Funding Loan Documents (taking into account any applicable grace periods therein).

Section 9.2. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.

(a) Subject to the provisions of Section 9.9 hereof, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under Section 9.1 hereof, then and in every such case, the Funding Lender may declare the principal of the Funding Loan and the Governmental Lender Note and the interest accrued to be immediately due and payable, by notice to the Governmental Lender and the Borrower and upon any such declaration, all principal of and Prepayment Premium, if any, and interest on the Funding Loan and the Governmental Lender Note shall become immediately due and payable.

(b) At any time after a declaration of acceleration has been made pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section, the Funding Lender may by Written Notice to the Governmental Lender, rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:

There has been deposited with the Funding Lender a sum sufficient to pay (1) all overdue installments of interest on the Governmental Lender Note, (2) the principal of and Prepayment Premium on the Governmental Lender Note that has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in the Governmental Lender Note, (3) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue installments of interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in the Governmental Lender Note, and (4) all sums paid or advanced by the Funding Lender and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Funding Lender, its agents and counsel (but only to the extent not duplicative with subclauses (1) and (3) above); and

All Events of Default, other than the non-payment of the principal of the Government Lender Note which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or have been waived in writing as provided in Section 9.9 hereof.

No such rescission and annulment shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.

Notwithstanding the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default, it is understood that the Funding Lender shall pursue no remedies against the Borrower or the Project if no Borrower Loan Agreement Default has occurred and is continuing. An Event of Default hereunder shall not in and of itself constitute a Borrower Loan Agreement Default or a default under any other Funding Loan Document.
Section 9.3. Additional Remedies; Funding Lender Enforcement.

(a) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Funding Lender may, subject to the provisions of this Section 9.3 and Section 9.9 hereof, proceed to protect and enforce its rights by mandamus or other suit, action or proceeding at law or in equity. No remedy conferred by this Funding Loan Agreement upon or remedy reserved to the Funding Lender is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, but each such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to any other remedy given to the Funding Lender hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute.

(b) Upon the occurrence and continuation of any Event of Default, the Funding Lender may proceed forthwith to protect and enforce its rights and this Funding Loan Agreement by such suits, actions or proceedings as the Funding Lender, in its sole discretion, shall deem expedient. Funding Lender shall have upon the occurrence and continuation of any Event of Default all rights, powers, and remedies with respect to the Security as are available under the Uniform Commercial Code applicable thereto or as are available under any other applicable law at the time in effect and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Funding Lender may proceed at law or in equity or otherwise, to the extent permitted by applicable law:

(i) to take possession of the Security or any part thereof, with or without legal process, and to hold, service, administer and enforce any rights thereunder or thereto, and otherwise exercise all rights of ownership thereof, including (but not limited to) the sale of all or part of the Security;

(ii) to become mortgagee of record for the Borrower Loan including, without limitation, completing the assignment of the Security Instrument by the Governmental Lender to the Funding Lender as anticipated by this Funding Loan Agreement, and recording the same in the real estate records of the jurisdiction in which the Project is located, without further act or consent of the Governmental Lender, and to service and administer the same for its own account;

(iii) to service and administer the Funding Loan as agent and on behalf of the Governmental Lender or otherwise, and, if applicable, to take such actions necessary to enforce the Borrower Loan Documents and the Funding Loan Documents on its own behalf, and to take such alternative courses of action, as it may deem appropriate; or

(iv) to take such steps to protect and enforce its rights whether by action, suit or proceeding in equity or at law for the specific performance of any covenant, condition or agreement in the Governmental Lender Note, this Funding Loan Agreement or the other Funding Loan Documents, or the Borrower Loan Documents, or in and of the execution of any power herein granted, or for foreclosure hereunder, or for enforcement of any other appropriate legal or equitable remedy or otherwise as the Funding Lender may elect.

Whether or not an Event of Default has occurred, and except as provided in Section 9.15, the Funding Lender, in its sole discretion, shall have the sole right to waive or forbear any term, condition, covenant or agreement of the Security Instrument, the Borrower Loan Agreement, the Borrower Note or any other Borrower Loan Documents or Funding Loan Documents applicable to the Borrower, or any breach thereof, other than a covenant that would adversely impact the tax-exempt status of the interest on the Governmental Lender Note, and provided that the Governmental Lender may enforce specific performance with respect to the Unassigned Rights.

If the Borrower defaults in the performance or observance of any covenant, agreement or obligation of the Borrower set forth in the Regulatory Agreement, and if such default remains uncured for a period of 60 days after the Borrower and the Funding Lender receive Written Notice stating that a default under the
Regulatory Agreement has occurred and specifying the nature of the default, the Funding Lender shall have the right to seek specific performance of the provisions of the Regulatory Agreement or to exercise its other rights or remedies thereunder.

If the Borrower defaults in the performance of its obligations under the Borrower Loan Agreement to make rebate payments, to comply with any applicable continuing disclosure requirements, or to make payments owed pursuant to Sections 2.4, 2.5, 5.14 or 5.15 of the Borrower Loan Agreement for fees, expenses or indemnification, the Funding Lender shall have the right to exercise all its rights and remedies thereunder (subject to the last paragraph of Section 9.14 hereof).

Section 9.4. Application of Money Collected. Any money collected by the Funding Lender pursuant to this Article and any other sums then held by the Funding Lender as part of the Security, shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Funding Lender:

(a) First: To the payment of any and all fees due the Governmental Lender, the Servicer or the Rebate Analyst under the Borrower Loan Documents;

(b) Second: To the payment of any and all amounts due under the Funding Loan Documents other than with respect to principal and interest accrued on the Funding Loan;

(c) Third: To the payment of the whole amount of the Funding Loan, as evidenced by the Governmental Lender Note, then due and unpaid in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, with interest (to the extent that such interest has been collected or a sum sufficient therefor has been so collected and payment thereof is legally enforceable at the respective rate or rates prescribed therefor in the Governmental Lender Note) on overdue principal of, and Prepayment Premium and overdue installments of interest on the Governmental Lender Note; provided, however, that partial interests in any portion of the Governmental Lender Note shall be paid in such order of priority as may be prescribed by Written Direction of the Funding Lender in its sole and absolute discretion; and

(d) Fourth: The payment of the remainder, if any, to the Borrower or to whosoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct.

(e) If and to the extent this Section 9.4 conflicts with the provisions of the Construction Funding Agreement or the Servicing Agreement, the provisions of the Construction Funding Agreement or Servicing Agreement shall control. Capitalized terms used in this Section 9.4 but not otherwise defined in this Funding Loan Agreement shall have the meanings given such terms in the Servicing Agreement.

Section 9.5. Remedies Vested in Funding Lender. All rights of action and claims under this Funding Loan Agreement or the Governmental Lender Note may be prosecuted and enforced by the Funding Lender without the possession of the Governmental Lender Note or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto.

Section 9.6. Restoration of Positions. If Funding Lender shall have instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Funding Loan Agreement and such proceeding shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason or shall have been determined adversely to the Funding Lender, then and in every such case the Governmental Lender and the Funding Lender shall, subject to any determination in such proceeding, be restored to their former positions hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Governmental Lender and the Funding Lender shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
Section 9.7. Rights and Remedies Cumulative. No right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Funding Lender is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

Section 9.8. Delay or Omission Not Waiver. No delay or omission of the Funding Lender to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Funding Lender may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by Funding Lender. No waiver of any default or Event of Default pursuant to Section 9.9 hereof shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default or Event of Default hereunder or shall impair any rights or remedies consequent thereon.

Section 9.9. Waiver of Past Defaults. Before any judgment or decree for payment of money due has been obtained by the Funding Lender, the Funding Lender may, subject to Section 9.6 hereof, by Written Notice to the Governmental Lender and the Borrower, waive any past default hereunder or under the Borrower Loan Agreement and its consequences except for default in obligations due the Governmental Lender pursuant to or under the Unassigned Rights. Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Funding Loan Agreement and the Borrower Loan Agreement; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.

Section 9.10. Remedies Under Borrower Loan Agreement or Borrower Note. As set forth in this Section 9.10 but subject to Section 9.9 hereof, the Funding Lender shall have the right, in its own name or on behalf of the Governmental Lender, to declare any default and exercise any remedies under the Borrower Loan Agreement or the Borrower Note, whether the Governmental Lender Note has been accelerated or declared due and payable by reason of an Event of Default.

Section 9.11. Waiver of Appraisement and Other Laws.

(a) To the extent permitted by law, the Governmental Lender will not at any time insist upon, plead, claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any appraisement, valuation, stay, extension or redemption law now or hereafter in force, in order to prevent or hinder the enforcement of this Funding Loan Agreement; and the Governmental Lender, for itself and all who may claim under it, so far as it or they now or hereafter may lawfully do so, hereby waives the benefit of all such laws. The Governmental Lender, for itself and all who may claim under it, waives, to the extent that it may lawfully do so, all right to have the property in the Security marshaled upon any enforcement hereof.

(b) If any law now in effect prohibiting the waiver referred to in Section 9.11(a) shall hereafter be repealed or cease to be in force, such law shall not thereafter be deemed to constitute any part of the contract herein contained or to preclude the application of this Section 9.11.

Section 9.12. Suits to Protect the Security. The Funding Lender shall have power to institute and to maintain such proceedings as it may deem expedient to prevent any impairment of the Security by any acts that may be unlawful or in violation of this Funding Loan Agreement and to protect its interests in the Security and in the rents, issues, profits, revenues and other income arising therefrom, including power to institute and maintain proceedings to restrain the enforcement of or compliance with any Governmental enactment, rule or order that may be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, if the enforcement of or compliance with such enactment, rule or order would impair the security hereunder or be prejudicial to the interests of the Funding Lender.
Section 9.13. Remedies Subject to Applicable Law. All rights, remedies and powers provided by this Article may be exercised only to the extent that the exercise thereof does not violate any applicable provision of law in the premises, and all the provisions of this Article are intended to be subject to all applicable mandatory provisions of law which may be controlling in the premises and to be limited to the extent necessary so that they will not render this Funding Loan Agreement invalid, unenforceable or not entitled to be recorded, registered or filed under the provisions of any applicable law.

Section 9.14. Assumption of Obligations. In the event that the Funding Lender or its permitted assignee or designee in accordance with Section 2.4 hereof shall become the legal or beneficial owner of the Project by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure, such party shall succeed to the rights and the obligations of the Borrower under the Borrower Loan Agreement, the Borrower Note, the Regulatory Agreement and any other Funding Loan Documents to which the Borrower is a party. Such assumption shall be effective from and after the effective date of such acquisition and shall be made with the benefit of the limitations of liability set forth therein and without any liability for the prior acts of the Borrower.

It is the intention of the parties hereto that upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default hereunder, rights and remedies may be pursued pursuant to the terms of the Funding Loan Documents, subject to the last paragraph of Section 9.2.

Section 9.15. Remedies upon Unremedied Material Funding Lender Event. Upon the occurrence of a Material Funding Lender Event which shall continue unremedied for a period of 60 days (a "Funding Lender Event of Default"), the Governmental Lender may direct that the Governmental Lender Note be transferred to and obligations and liabilities thereunder be assumed by another lender approved to act as Funding Lender by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.4(b) hereof and acceptable to the Governmental Lender; provided, however, that no such transfer shall become effective until (a) the Funding Lender has been fully reimbursed for all advances made and all expenses incurred and all other amounts owed to Funding Lender with respect to the Governmental Lender Note through the date of transfer, (b) the Funding Lender shall be fully released in writing by the Governmental Lender, the Borrower and the successor Funding Lender from any and all continuing obligations and liabilities with respect to the Funding Loan, (c) such other lender shall have executed and delivered to the Funding Lender the Required Transferee Representations and (d) Funding Lender shall be indemnified by the Borrower for any losses incurred by Funding Lender with respect to the Funding Loan (except losses arising from Funding Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary contained, Funding Lender shall not be liable to the Governmental Lender or the Borrower for any loss of tax-exemption, tax or other charge that may be imposed in connection with any such sale or assignment or for any fees and expenses incurred by the Governmental Lender or Borrower in connection therewith; nor shall the Funding Lender be liable to the Governmental Lender or Borrower for any special, indirect, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages, all such liability being expressly waived, to the fullest extent permitted by law.

Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of and all persons claiming under or through the Governmental Lender or any such successor or assign and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the successors and assigns of the Funding Lender.

Section 4.1.3 No Conflicts. The execution and delivery of the Borrower Loan Documents and the Funding Loan Documents to which the Borrower is a party, the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated and the fulfillment of or compliance with the terms and conditions hereof and thereof, will not conflict with or constitute a violation or breach of or default (with due notice or the passage of time or both) under the Partnership Agreement of the Borrower, or to the best knowledge of the Borrower and with respect to the Borrower, any applicable law or administrative rule or regulation, or any applicable court or administrative decree or order, or any mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease, contract or other agreement or instrument to which the Borrower is a party or by which it or its properties are otherwise subject or bound, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance of any nature whatsoever other than any lien contemplated by the Borrower Loan Documents, including but not limited to the liens of the Security Instrument and the Permitted Encumbrances, upon any of the property or assets of the Borrower, which conflict, violation, breach, default, lien, charge or encumbrance might have consequences that would materially and adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Borrower Loan Documents and the Funding Loan Documents, or the financial condition, assets, properties or operations of the Borrower.

Section 4.1.4 Litigation; Adverse Facts. There is no Legal Action, nor is there a basis known to Borrower for any Legal Action, before or by any court or federal, state, municipal or other governmental authority, pending, or to the knowledge of the Borrower, after reasonable investigation, threatened, against or affecting the Borrower, the General Partner or the Guarantor(s), or their respective assets, properties or operations which, if determined adversely to the Borrower, General Partner, or such Guarantor or their respective interests, would have a material adverse effect upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by, or the validity of, the Borrower Loan Documents or the Funding Loan Documents, upon the ability of each of Borrower, General Partner and Guarantor to perform their respective obligations under the Borrower Loan Documents, the Funding Loan Documents and the Related Documents to which it is a party, or upon the financial condition, assets (including the Project), properties or operations of the Borrower, the General Partner and Guarantor(s), none of the Borrower, General Partner or any Guarantor is in default (and no event has occurred and is continuing which with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both could constitute a default) with respect to any order or decree of any court or any order, regulation or demand of any federal, state, municipal or other governmental authority, which default might have consequences that would materially and adversely affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Borrower Loan Documents and the Funding Loan Documents, the ability of each of Borrower, General Partner and each Guarantor to perform their respective obligations under the Borrower Loan Documents, the Funding Loan Documents and the Related Documents to which it is a party, or the financial condition, assets, properties or operations of the Borrower, General Partner or any Guarantor. None of the Borrower, General Partner or any Guarantor are (a) in violation of any applicable law, which violation materially and adversely affects or may materially and adversely affect the business, operations, assets (including the Project), condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of Borrower, General Partner or such Guarantor, as applicable; (b) subject to, or in default with respect to, any other Legal Requirement that would have a material adverse effect on the business, operations, assets (including the Project), condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of Borrower, General Partner or any Guarantor, as applicable; or (c) in default with respect to any agreement to which Borrower, General Partner or any Guarantor, as applicable, is a party or by which it is bound, which default would have a material adverse effect on the business, operations, assets (including the Project), condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of Borrower, General Partner or Guarantor, as applicable; and (d) there is no Legal Action pending or, to the knowledge of Borrower, threatened against or affecting Borrower, General Partner or any Guarantor questioning the validity or the enforceability of this Borrower Loan Agreement or any of the other Borrower Loan Documents or the Funding Loan Documents or of any of the Related Documents.

The Borrower is not in default in any material respect in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or conditions contained in any Permitted Encumbrance or any other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or the Project is bound.

No consent or approval of any trustee or holder of any indebtedness of the Borrower, and to the best knowledge of the Borrower and only with respect to the Borrower, no consent, permission, authorization, order or license of, or filing or registration with, any governmental authority (except no representation is made with respect to any state securities or "blue sky" laws) is necessary in connection with the execution and delivery of the Borrower Loan Documents or the Funding Loan Documents, or the consummation of any transaction herein or therein contemplated, or the fulfillment of or compliance with the terms and conditions hereof or thereof, except as have been obtained or made and as are in full force and effect.

Section 4.1.6 Title. The Borrower shall have marketable title to the Project, free and clear of all Liens except the Permitted Encumbrances.

Borrower shall not enter into, or be a party to, any transaction with an Affiliate of Borrower or Guarantor except in the ordinary course of business and on terms that are fully disclosed to Funding Lender in writing and are no less favorable to such Affiliate than would be obtained in a comparable arm’s length transaction with an unrelated third party.

Section 4.1.13 Financial Information.

To the Borrower's knowledge, all Licenses obtained by the Borrower have been validly issued and are in full force and effect. The Borrower has no reason to believe that any of the Licenses required for the future use and occupancy of the Project and not heretofore obtained by the Borrower will not be obtained by the Borrower in the ordinary course following the Completion Date. The Project does not violate any density or building setback requirements of the applicable zoning law except to the extent, if any, shown on the survey.

The obligations and liabilities of the Borrower under this Section 5.14 shall survive the Term of this Borrower Loan Agreement and the exercise by the Governmental Lender, the Funding Lender or the Servicer, as the case may be, of any of its rights or remedies under the Borrower Loan Documents and the Funding Loan Documents, including the acquisition of the Project by foreclosure or a conveyance in lieu of foreclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay amounts incurred as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any other party, and any obligations of the Borrower to pay for environmental inspections or audits will be governed by the Agreement of Environmental Indemnification.

(j) any failure by Borrower or Governmental Lender to comply with applicable federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the making of the Borrower Loan and the Funding Loan;

(k) the Project, or the condition, occupancy, use, possession, conduct or management of, or work done in or about, or from the planning, design, acquisition, installation, construction or rehabilitation of, the Project or any part thereof; or

except in the case of the foregoing indemnification of the Governmental Lender, the Funding Lender or the Servicer or any related Indemnified Party, to the extent such damages are caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party.

Without limiting the foregoing, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Borrower agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Governmental Lender, and each of its officers, officials, directors, employees, attorneys and agents ("City Indemnified Parties") against any Liability to which the City Indemnified Parties, or any of them, may become subject under federal or state securities laws or any other statutory law or at common law or otherwise, to the extent arising out of or based upon or in any way relating to any declaration of taxability of interest on the Funding Loan or allegations (or regulatory inquiry) that interest on the Funding Loan is taxable for federal income tax purposes, except to the extent such damages are caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of a City Indemnified Party.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Borrower’s indemnification obligations to the parties specified in Section 9.1.4 hereof with respect to any securitization or Secondary Market Transaction described in Article IX hereof shall be limited to the indemnity set forth in Section 9.1.4 hereof. In the event that any action or proceeding is brought against any Indemnified Party with respect to which indemnity may be sought hereunder, the Borrower, upon written notice from the Indemnified Party (which notice shall be timely given so as not to materially impair the Borrower’s right to defend), shall assume the investigation and defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably approved by the Indemnified Party, and shall assume the payment of all reasonable expenses related thereto, with full power to litigate, compromise or settle the same in its sole discretion; provided that the Indemnified Party shall have the right to review and approve or disapprove any such compromise or settlement, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Each Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action or proceeding and to participate in the investigation and defense thereof; provided, however, the Governmental Lender shall have the absolute right to employ separate counsel at the reasonable expense of the Borrower. The Borrower shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel; provided, however, that such Indemnified Party may only employ separate counsel at the expense of the Borrower if and only if in such Indemnified Party’s good faith judgment (based on the advice
of counsel) a conflict of interest exists or could arise by reason of common representation, except that the Borrower shall always pay the reasonable fees and expenses of the Governmental Lender's separate counsel.

Notwithstanding any transfer of the Project to another owner in accordance with the provisions of this Borrower Loan Agreement or the Regulatory Agreement, the Borrower shall remain obligated to indemnify each Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 5.15 if such subsequent owner fails to indemnify any party entitled to be indemnified hereunder, unless the Governmental Lender and the Funding Lender have consented to such transfer and to the assignment of the rights and obligations of the Borrower hereunder.

The rights of any persons to indemnity and the right to payment of fees and reimbursement of expenses hereunder shall survive the final payment or defeasance of the Borrower Loan and the Funding Loan and in the case of the Servicer, any resignation or removal.

For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term "rehabilitation expenditures" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 147(d)(3) of the Code.

(vi) **Accuracy of Information.** The information furnished by the Borrower and used by the Governmental Lender in preparing its certifications with respect to Section 148 of the Code and the Borrower's information statement pursuant to Section 149(e) of the Code is accurate and complete as of the date of origination of the Funding Loan.

(a) Arbitrage Rebate. The Borrower agrees to take all steps necessary to compute and pay any rebatable arbitrage relating to the Funding Loan or the Governmental Lender Note in accordance with Section 148(f) of the Code including:

(i) Delivery of Documents and Money on Computation Dates. The Borrower will deliver to the Servicer, within 55 days after each Computation Date:

(A) a statement, signed by the Borrower, stating the Rebate Amount as of such Computation Date;

(B) if such Computation Date is an Installment Computation Date, an amount that, together with any amount then held for the credit of the Rebate Fund, is equal to at least 90% of the Rebate Amount as of such Installment Computation Date, less any “previous rebate payments” made to the United States (as that term is used in Section 1.148-3(f)(1) of the Regulations), or (2) if such Computation Date is the final Computation Date, an amount that, together with any amount then held for the credit of the Rebate Fund, is equal to the Rebate Amount as of such final Computation Date, less any “previous rebate payments” made to the United States (as that term is used in Section 1.148-3(f)(1) of the Regulations); and

(C) an Internal Revenue Service Form 8038-T properly signed and completed as of such Computation Date.

(ii) Correction of Underpayments. If the Borrower shall discover or be notified as of any date that any payment paid to the United States Treasury pursuant to this Section 5.35 of an amount described in Section 5.35(a)(i)(A) or (B) above shall have failed to satisfy any requirement of Section 1.148-3 of the Regulations (whether or not such failure shall be due to any default by the Borrower, the Governmental Lender or the Funding Lender), the Borrower shall (1) pay to the Servicer (for deposit to the Rebate Fund) and cause the Servicer to pay to the United States Treasury from the Rebate Fund the underpayment of the Rebate Amount, together with any penalty and/or interest due, as specified in Section 1.148-3(h) of the Regulations, within 175 days after any discovery or notice and (2) deliver to the Servicer an Internal Revenue Service Form 8038-T completed as of such date. If such underpayment of the Rebate Amount, together with any penalty and/or interest due, is not paid to the United States Treasury in the amount and manner and by the
time specified in the Regulations, the Borrower shall take such steps as are necessary to prevent the Governmental Lender Note from becoming an arbitrage bond within the meaning of Section 148 of the Code.

(iii) Records. The Borrower shall retain all of its accounting records relating to the funds established under this Borrower Loan Agreement and all calculations made in preparing the statements described in this Section 5.35 for at least six years after the later of the final maturity of the Governmental Lender Note or the date the Funding Loan is retired in full.

(iv) Costs. The Borrower agrees to pay all of the fees and expenses of a nationally recognized Tax Counsel, the Rebate Analyst, a certified public accountant and any other necessary consultant employed by the Borrower or the Funding Lender in connection with computing the Rebate Amount.

(v) No Diversion of Rebatable Arbitrage. The Borrower will not indirectly pay any amount otherwise payable to the federal government pursuant to the foregoing requirements to any person other than the federal government by entering into any investment arrangement with respect to the Gross Proceeds of the Funding Loan which is not purchased at Fair Market Value or includes terms that the Borrower would not have included if the Funding Loan were not subject to Section 148(f) of the Code.

(vi) Modification of Requirements. If at any time during the term of this Agreement, the Governmental Lender, the Funding Lender or the Borrower desires to take any action which would otherwise be prohibited by the terms of this Section 5.35, such Person shall be permitted to take such action if it shall first obtain and provide to the other Persons named herein a Tax Counsel No Adverse Effect Opinion with respect to such action.

(b) Rebate Fund. The Servicer shall establish and hold a separate fund designated as the "Rebate Fund." The Servicer shall deposit or transfer to the credit of the Rebate Fund each amount delivered to the Servicer by the Borrower for deposit thereto and each amount directed by the Borrower to be transferred thereto.

(c) Within 15 days after each receipt or transfer of funds to the Rebate Fund, the Servicer shall withdraw from the Rebate Fund and pay to the United States of America the entire balance of the Rebate Fund.

(d) All payments to the United States of America pursuant to this Section 5.35 shall be made by the Servicer for the account and in the name of the Governmental Lender and shall be paid through the United States Mail (return receipt requested or overnight delivery), addressed to the appropriate Internal Revenue Service Center and accompanied by the appropriate Internal Revenue Service forms (such forms to be provided to the Servicer by the Borrower or the Rebate Analyst as set forth in this Section 5.35).

(e) The Borrower shall preserve all statements, forms and explanations received delivered pursuant this Section 5.35 and all records of transactions in the Rebate Fund until six years after the retirement of the Funding Loan.

(f) Moneys and securities held in the Rebate Fund shall not be deemed funds of the Funding Lender or of the Governmental Lender and are not pledged or otherwise subject to any security interest in favor of the Funding Lender to secure the Funding Loan or any other obligations.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Borrower Loan Agreement, no payment shall be made to the United States if the Borrower shall furnish to the Governmental Lender and the Funding Lender an opinion of Tax Counsel to the effect that such payment is not required under Section 148(d) and
(f) of the Code in order to maintain the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of interest on the Governmental Lender Note. In such event, the Borrower shall be entitled to withdraw funds from the Rebate Fund to the extent the Borrower shall provide a Tax Counsel No Adverse Effect Opinion to the Governmental Lender and the Funding Lender with respect to such withdrawal.

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the computations and payments of rebate amounts referred to in this Section 5.35 need not be made to the extent that neither the Governmental Lender nor the Borrower will thereby fail to comply with any requirements of Section 148(f) of the Code based on a Tax Counsel No Adverse Effect Opinion, a copy of which shall be provided to the Funding Lender.

Section 5.36. Covenants under Funding Loan Agreement. The Borrower will fully and faithfully perform all the duties and obligations which the Governmental Lender has covenanted and agreed in the Funding Loan Agreement to cause the Borrower to perform and any duties and obligations which the Borrower is required in the Funding Loan Agreement to perform. The foregoing will not apply to any duty or undertaking of the Governmental Lender which by its nature cannot be delegated or assigned.

Section 5.37. Notice of Default. The Borrower will advise the Governmental Lender, the Funding Lender, and the Servicer promptly in writing of the occurrence of any Potential Default or Event of Default hereunder, specifying the nature and period of existence of such event and the actions being taken or proposed to be taken with respect thereto.

Section 5.38. Continuing Disclosure Agreement. The Borrower and the Funding Lender shall enter into the Continuing Disclosure Agreement to provide for the continuing disclosure of information about the Governmental Lender Note, the Borrower and other matters as specifically provided for in such agreement.

Section 5.39. Compliance with the CC&Rs. Borrower will do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to preserve and keep unimpaired the rights of Borrower under the CC&Rs, and to prevent any default or failure of condition under the CC&Rs or any termination or cancellation thereof. Borrower will keep, observe and perform, or cause to be kept, observed and performed, all of the terms, covenants, provisions and agreements contained in the CC&Rs on the part of the Borrower to be kept, observed and performed. Without the prior Written Consent of the Servicer, or if there is no Servicer, the Funding Lender, the Borrower will not terminate, cancel (or permit any cancellation or termination), modify, change, supplement, alter, amend, waive, release, assign, transfer, pledge or hypothecated any of its rights or remedies under CC&Rs and any attempt on the Borrower to do so without such prior written consent of Funding Lender shall be null and void and of no effect.

In the event that any cure period provided herein with respect to a particular default is inconsistent with the cure period (if any) relating to a similar default set forth in the Construction Funding Agreement, the terms of the Construction Funding Agreement shall control.

Section 8.2. Remedies.

Section 8.2.1 Acceleration. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in paragraph (e), (f) or (i) of Section 8.1) and at any time and from time to time thereafter, as long as such Event of Default continues to exist, in addition to any other rights or remedies available to the Governmental Lender pursuant to the Borrower Loan Documents or at law or in equity, the Funding Lender may, take such action, without notice or demand, as the Funding Lender deems advisable to protect and enforce its rights against the Borrower and in and to the Project, including declaring the Borrower Payment Obligations to be immediately due and payable (including, without limitation, the principal of, Prepayment Premium, if any, and interest on and all other amounts due on the Borrower Note to be immediately due and payable), without notice or demand, and apply such payment of the Borrower Payment Obligations in any manner and in any order determined by Funding Lender, in Funding Lender's
sole and absolute discretion; and upon any Event of Default described in paragraph (e), (f) or (i) of Section 8.1, the Borrower Payment Obligations shall become immediately due and payable, without notice or demand, and the Borrower hereby expressly waives any such notice or demand, anything contained in any Borrower Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, enforcement of remedies hereunder and under the Funding Loan Agreement shall be controlled by the Funding Lender.

Section 8.2.2 Remedies Cumulative. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, all or any one or more of the rights, powers, privileges and other remedies available to the Funding Lender against the Borrower under the Borrower Loan Documents or at law or in equity may be exercised by the Funding Lender, at any time and from time to time, whether or not all or any of the Borrower Payment Obligations shall be declared due and payable, and whether or not the Funding Lender shall have commenced any foreclosure proceeding or other action for the enforcement of its rights and remedies under any of the Borrower Loan Documents. Any such actions taken by the Funding Lender shall be cumulative and concurrent and may be pursued independently, singly, successively, together or otherwise, at such time and in such order as the Funding Lender may determine in its sole discretion, to the fullest extent permitted by law, without impairing or otherwise affecting the other rights and remedies of the Funding Lender permitted by law, equity or contract or as set forth in the Borrower Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Borrower agrees that if an Event of Default is continuing, all Liens and other rights, remedies or privileges provided to the Funding Lender shall remain in full force and effect until they have exhausted all of its remedies, the Security Instrument has been foreclosed, the Project has been sold and/or otherwise realized upon satisfaction of the Borrower Payment Obligations or the Borrower Payment Obligations has been paid in full. To the extent permitted by applicable law, nothing contained in any Borrower Loan Document shall be construed as requiring the Funding Lender to resort to any portion of the Project for the satisfaction of any of the Borrower Payment Obligations in preference or priority to any other portion, and the Funding Lender may seek satisfaction out of the Project or any part thereof, in its absolute discretion.

Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Governmental Lender and the Funding Lender agree that any cure of any default made or tendered by the Equity Investor shall be deemed to be a cure by the Borrower and shall be accepted or rejected on the same basis as if made or tendered by the Borrower.

Section 8.2.3 Delay. No delay or omission to exercise any remedy, right, power accruing upon an Event of Default, or the granting of any indulgence or compromise by the Funding Lender shall impair any such remedy, right or power hereunder or be construed as a waiver thereof, but any such remedy, right or power may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. A waiver of one Potential Default or Event of Default shall not be construed to be a waiver of any subsequent Potential Default or Event of Default or to impair any remedy, right or power consequent thereon. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Borrower Loan Agreement, the Funding Lender reserves the right to seek a deficiency judgment or preserve a deficiency claim, in connection with the foreclosure of the Security Instrument to the extent necessary to foreclose on the Project, the Rents, the funds or any other collateral.

Section 8.2.4 Set Off; Waiver of Set Off. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Funding Lender may, at any time and from time to time, without notice to Borrower or any other Person (any such notice being expressly waived), set off and appropriate and apply (against and on account of any obligations and liabilities of Borrower to Funding Lender arising under or connected with this Borrower Loan Agreement and the other Borrower Loan Documents and the Funding Loan Documents, irrespective of whether or not Funding Lender shall have made any demand therefor, and although such obligations and liabilities may be contingent or unmatured), and Borrower hereby grants to Funding Lender, as security for the Borrower Payment Obligations, a security interest in, any and all deposits (general or special, including but not limited to Debt evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured, but not
including trust accounts) and any other Debt at any time held or owing by Funding Lender to or for the credit or the account of Borrower.

Section 8.2.5 Assumption of Obligations. In the event that the Funding Lender or its assignee or designee shall become the legal or beneficial owner of the Project by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure, such party shall succeed to the rights and the obligations of the Borrower under this Borrower Loan Agreement, the Borrower Note, the Regulatory Agreement, and any other Borrower Loan Documents and Funding Loan Documents to which the Borrower is a party. Such assumption shall be effective from and after the effective date of such acquisition and shall be made with the benefit of the limitations of liability set forth therein and without any liability for the prior acts (or inaction) of the Borrower.

Section 8.2.6 Accounts Receivable. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Funding Lender shall have the right, to the extent permitted by law, to impound and take possession of books, records, notes and other documents evidencing Borrower's accounts, accounts receivable and other claims for payment of money, arising in connection with the Project, and to make direct collections on such accounts, accounts receivable and claims for the benefit of Funding Lender.

Section 8.2.7 Defaults under Other Documents. Funding Lender shall have the right to cure any default under any of the Related Documents and the Subordinate Loan Documents, but shall have no obligation to do so.

Section 8.2.8 Abatement of Disbursements. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein or any of the other Borrower Loan Documents or the Funding Loan Documents, Funding Lender's obligation to make further Disbursements shall abate (i) during the continuance of any Potential Default, (ii) after any disclosure to Funding Lender of any fact or circumstance that, absent such disclosure, would cause any representation or warranty of Borrower to fail to be true and correct in all material respects, unless and until Funding Lender elects to permit further Disbursements notwithstanding such event or circumstance; and (iii) upon the occurrence of any Event of Default.

Section 8.2.9 Completion of Improvements. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, and continuing until and unless such Event of Default is cured or waived in writing, Funding Lender shall have the right to cause an independent contractor selected by Funding Lender to enter into possession of the Project and to perform any and all work and labor necessary for the completion of the Project substantially in accordance with the Plans and Specifications, if any, and to perform Borrower's obligations under this Borrower Loan Agreement. All sums expended by Funding Lender for such purposes shall be deemed to have been disbursed to and borrowed by Borrower and shall be secured by the Security Documents.

Section 8.2.10 Right to Directly Enforce. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary, the Funding Lender shall have the right to directly enforce all rights and remedies hereunder with or without involvement of the Governmental Lender, provided that only the Governmental Lender may enforce the Unassigned Rights that exclusively benefit Governmental Lender and Funding Lender shall not impair Governmental Lender's enforcement of such Unassigned Rights. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Governmental Lender and the Funding Lender shall have the right to enforce all rights and remedies under Sections 5.14, 5.15 and 5.17, with or without involvement of the other party. In the event that any of the provisions set forth in this Section 8.2.10 are inconsistent with the covenants, terms and conditions of the Security Instrument or the Construction Funding Agreement, the covenants, terms and conditions of the Security Instrument or the Construction Funding Agreement shall prevail.

Section 8.2.11 Power of Attorney. Effective upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, and continuing until and unless such Event of Default is cured or waived, Borrower hereby constitutes and appoints Funding Lender, or an independent contractor selected by Funding Lender, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution, for the purposes of completion of the Project and
performance of Borrower's obligations under this Borrower Loan Agreement in the name of Borrower, and hereby empowers said attorney-in-fact to do any or all of the following upon the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default (it being understood and agreed that said power of attorney shall be deemed to be a power coupled with an interest which cannot be revoked until full payment and performance of all obligations under this Borrower Loan Agreement and the other Borrower Loan Documents and the Funding Loan Documents):

(a) to use any of the funds of Borrower or General Partner, including any balance of the Borrower Loan, as applicable, and any funds which may be held by Funding Lender for Borrower (including all funds in all deposit accounts in which Borrower has granted to Funding Lender a security interest), for the purpose of effecting completion of the construction or rehabilitation, as the case may be, of the Improvements, in the manner called for by the Plans and Specifications;

(b) to make such additions, changes and corrections in the Plans and Specifications as shall be necessary or desirable to complete the Project in substantially the manner contemplated by the Plans and Specifications;

(c) to employ any contractors, subcontractors, agents, architects and inspectors required for said purposes;

(d) to employ attorneys to defend against attempts to interfere with the exercise of power granted hereby;

(e) to pay, settle or compromise all existing bills and claims which are or may be liens against the Project, the Improvements or the Project, or may be necessary or desirable for the completion of the construction or rehabilitation, as the case may be, of the Improvements, or clearance of objections to or encumbrances on title;

(f) to execute all applications and certificates in the name of Borrower, which may be required by any other construction contract;

(g) to prosecute and defend all actions or proceedings in connection with the Project and to take such action, require such performance and do any and every other act as is deemed necessary with respect to the completion of the construction or rehabilitation, as the case may be, of the Improvements, which Borrower might do on its own behalf;

(h) to let new or additional contracts to the extent not prohibited by their existing contracts;

(i) to employ watchmen and erect security fences to protect the Project from injury; and

(j) to take such action and require such performance as it deems necessary under any of the bonds or insurance policies to be furnished hereunder, to make settlements and compromises with the sureties or insurers thereunder, and in connection therewith to execute instruments of release and satisfaction.

It is the intention of the parties hereto that upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, rights and remedies may be pursued pursuant to the terms of the Borrower Loan Documents and the Funding Loan Documents. The parties hereto acknowledge that, among the possible outcomes to the pursuit of such remedies, is the situation where the Funding Lender assignees or designees become the owner of the Project and assume the obligations identified above, and the Borrower Note, the Borrower Loan and the other Borrower Loan Documents and Funding Loan Documents remain outstanding.

SPECIAL PROVISIONS

Section 9.1. Sale of Note and Secondary Market Transaction.

Section 9.1.1 Cooperation. Subject to the restrictions of Section 2.4(b) of the Funding Loan Agreement, at the Funding Lender's or the Servicer's request (to the extent not already required to be provided by the Borrower under this Borrower Loan Agreement), the Borrower shall use reasonable efforts to satisfy the market standards to which the Funding Lender or the Servicer customarily adheres or which may be reasonably required in the marketplace or by the Funding Lender or the Servicer in connection with one or more sales or assignments of all or a portion of the Governmental Lender Note and the Funding Loan or participations therein or securitizations of single or multi-class securities (the "Securities") secured by or evidencing ownership interests in all or a portion of the Governmental Lender Notes and the Funding Loan (each such sale, assignment and/or securitization, a "Secondary Market Transaction"); provided that neither the Borrower nor the Governmental Lender shall incur any third party or other out-of-pocket costs and expenses in connection with a Secondary Market Transaction, including the costs associated with the delivery of any Provided Information or any opinion required in connection therewith, and all such costs shall be paid by the Funding Lender or the Servicer, and shall not materially modify Borrower's rights or obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Borrower shall, so long as the Borrower Loan is still outstanding:

(a) (i) provide such financial and other information with respect to the Borrower Loan, and with respect to the Project, the Borrower, the Manager, the contractor of the Project or the Borrower Controlling Entity, (ii) provide financial statements, audited, if available, relating to the Project with customary disclaimers for any forward looking statements or lack of audit, and (iii), at the expense of the Funding Lender or the Servicer, perform or permit or cause to be performed or permitted such site inspection, appraisals, surveys, market studies, environmental reviews and reports ([Phase I's and, if appropriate, Phase II's]), engineering reports and other due diligence investigations of the Project, as may be reasonably requested from time to time by the Funding Lender or the Servicer or the Rating Agencies or as may be necessary or appropriate in connection with a Secondary Market Transaction or Exchange Act requirements (the items provided to the Funding Lender or the Servicer pursuant to this paragraph (a) being called the "Provided Information"), together, if customary, with appropriate verification of and/or consents to the Provided Information through letters of auditors or opinions of counsel of independent attorneys acceptable to the Funding Lender or the Servicer and the Rating Agencies;

(b) make such representations and warranties as of the closing date of any Secondary Market Transaction with respect to the Project, the Borrower, the Borrower Loan Documents and the Funding Loan Documents reasonably acceptable to the Funding Lender or the Servicer, consistent with the facts covered by such representations and warranties as they exist on the date thereof; and

(c) execute such amendments to the Borrower Loan Documents and the Funding Loan Documents to accommodate such Secondary Market Transaction so long as such amendment does not affect the material economic terms of the Borrower Loan Documents and the Funding Loan Documents and is not otherwise adverse to the Borrower in its reasonable discretion.

The Funding Lender agrees to deal equitably in accordance with its standard business practices with the Borrower and Governmental Lender regarding any Secondary Market Transaction.

Section 9.1.2 Use of Information. The Borrower understands that certain of the Provided Information and the required records may be included in disclosure documents in connection with a Secondary Market Transaction, including a prospectus or private placement memorandum (each, a
"Secondary Market Disclosure Document"), or provided or made available to investors or prospective investors in the Securities, the Rating Agencies and service providers or other parties relating to the Secondary Market Transaction. In the event that the Secondary Market Disclosure Document is required to be revised, the Borrower shall cooperate, subject to Section 9.1.1(c) hereof, with the Funding Lender and the Servicer in updating the Provided Information or required records for inclusion or summary in the Secondary Market Disclosure Document or for other use reasonably required in connection with a Secondary Market Transaction by providing all reasonably requested current information pertaining to the Borrower and the Project necessary to keep the Secondary Market Disclosure Document accurate and complete in all material respects with respect to such matters. The Borrower hereby consents to any and all such disclosures of such information.

Section 9.1.3 Borrower Obligations Regarding Secondary Market Disclosure Documents. In connection with a Secondary Market Disclosure Document, the Borrower shall provide, or in the case of a Borrower-engaged third party such as the Manager, cause it to provide, information reasonably requested by the Funding Lender pertaining to the Borrower, the Project or such third party (and portions of any other sections reasonably requested by the Funding Lender pertaining to the Borrower, the Project or the third party). The Borrower shall, if requested by the Funding Lender and the Servicer, certify in writing that the Borrower has carefully examined those portions of such Secondary Market Disclosure Document, pertaining to the Borrower, the Project or the Manager, and such portions (and portions of any other sections reasonably requested and pertaining to the Borrower, the Project or the Manager) do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to make any representations or warranties regarding any Provided Information obtained from a third party except with respect to information it provided to such parties. Furthermore, the Borrower hereby indemnifies the Funding Lender, the Governmental Lender and the Servicer for any Liabilities to which any such parties may become subject to the extent such Liabilities arise out of or are based upon the use of the Provided Information in a Secondary Market Disclosure Document; provided that the Borrower shall not provide any indemnification regarding any Provided Information obtained from unrelated third parties except with respect to information it provided to such parties nor shall Borrower provide indemnification for any Liabilities arising out of or based upon the fraudulent acts or omissions, willful misconduct, or gross negligence of any party to be indemnified herein.

Section 9.1.4 Borrower Indemnity Regarding Filings. In connection with filings under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, the Borrower shall (i) indemnify Funding Lender, the Governmental Lender and the underwriter group for any securities (the "Underwriter Group") and all officials, employees and agents of any of them for any Liabilities to which Funding Lender, the Servicer or the Underwriter Group may become subject insofar as the Liabilities arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in the Provided Information of a material fact required to be stated in the Provided Information in order to make the statements in the Provided Information, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading and (ii) reimburse the Funding Lender, the Servicer, the Underwriter Group and other indemnified parties listed above for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Funding Lender, the Servicer or the Underwriter Group in connection with defending or investigating such Liabilities; provided that the Borrower shall not provide any indemnification regarding any Provided Information obtained from unrelated third parties except with respect to information it provided to such parties nor shall Borrower provide indemnification for any Liabilities arising out of or based upon the fraudulent acts or omissions, willful misconduct, or gross negligence of any party to be indemnified herein.

Section 9.1.5 Indemnification Procedure. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Sections 9.1.3 and 9.1.4 hereof of notice of the commencement of any action for which a claim for indemnification is to be made against the Borrower, such indemnified party shall notify the Borrower in
writing of such commencement, but the omission to so notify the Borrower will not relieve the Borrower from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party hereunder except to the extent that failure to notify causes prejudice to the Borrower. In the event that any action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the Borrower of the commencement thereof, the Borrower will be entitled, jointly with any other indemnifying party, to participate therein and, to the extent that it (or they) may elect by Written Notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice of commencement, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Borrower and reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party in its sole discretion. After notice from the Borrower to such indemnified party under this Section 9.1.5, the Borrower shall not be responsible for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnified party shall settle or compromise any claim for which the Borrower may be liable hereunder without the prior Written Consent of the Borrower.

Section 9.1.6 Contribution. In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in Section 9.1.4 hereof is for any reason held to be unenforceable by an indemnified party in respect of any Liabilities (or action in respect thereof) referred to therein which would otherwise be indemnifiable under Section 9.1.4 hereof, the Borrower shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such Liabilities (or action in respect thereof); provided, however, that no Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 10(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. In determining the amount of contribution to which the respective parties are entitled, the following factors shall be considered: (i) the indemnified parties and the Borrower's relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted; (ii) the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission; and (iii) any other equitable considerations appropriate in the circumstances. The parties hereto hereby agree that it may not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation.

The Borrower hereby represents that it has dealt with no financial advisors, brokers, underwriters, placement agents, agents or finders in connection with the Borrower Loan, other than those disclosed to the Funding Lender and whose fees shall be paid by the Borrower pursuant to separate agreements. The Borrower and the Funding Lender shall indemnify and hold the other harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, costs and expenses of any kind in any way relating to or arising from a claim by any Person that such Person acted on behalf of the indemnifying party in connection with the transactions contemplated herein.

Section 10.3. Survival. This Borrower Loan Agreement and all covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made herein and, in the certificates, delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the making by the Governmental Lender of the Borrower Loan and the execution and delivery to the Governmental Lender of the Borrower Note and the assignment of the Borrower Note to the Funding Lender, and shall continue in full force and effect so long as all or any of the Borrower Payment Obligations is unpaid. All the Borrower’s covenants and agreements in this Borrower Loan Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the respective legal representatives, successors and assigns of the Governmental Lender, the Funding Lender and the Servicer.

Section 10.4. Preferences. The Governmental Lender and Funding Lender shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply or reverse and reapply any and all payments by the Borrower to any portion of the Borrower Payment Obligations. To the extent the Borrower makes a payment to the Governmental Lender or the Funding Lender, or the Governmental Lender or the Funding Lender receives proceeds of any collateral, which is in whole or part subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment or proceeds received, the Borrower Payment Obligations or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continue in full force and effect, as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by the Governmental Lender or the Funding Lender.

Section 10.5. Waiver of Notice. The Borrower shall not be entitled to any notices of any nature whatsoever from the Funding Lender or the Servicer except with respect to matters for which this Borrower Loan Agreement or any other Borrower Loan Document specifically and expressly provides for the giving of notice by the Funding Lender or the Servicer, as the case may be, to the Borrower and except with respect to matters for which the Borrower is not, pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements, permitted to waive the giving of notice. The Borrower hereby expressly waives the right to receive any notice from the Funding Lender or the Servicer, as the case may be, with respect to any matter for which no Borrower Loan Document specifically and expressly provides for the giving of notice by the Funding Lender or the Servicer to the Borrower.

Section 10.6. Offsets, Counterclaims and Defenses. The Borrower hereby waives the right to assert a counterclaim, other than a compulsory counterclaim, in any action or proceeding brought against it by the Funding Lender or the Servicer with respect to a Borrower Loan Payment. Any assignee of Funding Lender’s interest in and to the Borrower Loan Documents or the Funding Loan Documents shall take the same free and clear of all offsets, counterclaims or defenses that are unrelated to the Borrower Loan Documents or the Funding Loan Documents which the Borrower may otherwise have against any assignor of such documents, and no such unrelated offset, counterclaim or defense shall be interposed or asserted by
the Borrower in any action or proceeding brought by any such assignee upon such documents, and any such right to interpose or assert any such unrelated offset, counterclaim or defense in any such action or proceeding is hereby expressly waived by the Borrower.

Section 10.7. Publicity. The Funding Lender and the Servicer (and any affiliates of either party) shall have the right to issue press releases, advertisements and other promotional materials describing the Funding Lender's or the Servicer's participation in the making of the Borrower Loan or the Borrower Loan's inclusion in any Secondary Market Transaction effectuated by the Funding Lender or the Servicer or one of its or their affiliates. All news releases, publicity or advertising by the Borrower or its Affiliates through any media intended to reach the general public, which refers to the Borrower Loan Documents or the Funding Loan Documents, the Borrower Loan, the Funding Lender or the Servicer in a Secondary Market Transaction, shall be subject to the prior Written Consent of the Funding Lender or the Servicer, as applicable.

Section 10.8. Construction of Documents. The parties hereto acknowledge that they were represented by counsel in connection with the negotiation and drafting of the Borrower Loan Documents and the Funding Loan Documents and that the Borrower Loan Documents and the Funding Loan Documents shall not be subject to the principle of construing their meaning against the party that drafted them.

Section 10.9. No Third-Party Beneficiaries. The Borrower Loan Documents and the Funding Loan Documents are solely for the benefit of the Governmental Lender, the Funding Lender, the Servicer and the Borrower and, with respect to Sections 9.1.3 and 9.1.4 hereof, the Underwriter Group, and nothing contained in any Borrower Loan Document shall be deemed to confer upon anyone other than the Governmental Lender, the Funding Lender, the Servicer, and the Borrower any right to insist upon or to enforce the performance or observance of any of the obligations contained therein.

Section 10.10. Assignment. The Borrower Loan, the Security Instrument, the Borrower Loan Documents and the Funding Loan Documents and all Funding Lender's rights, title, obligations and interests therein may be assigned by the Funding Lender, at any time with written notice to, but without any requirement of the consent of, the Borrower, whether by operation of law (pursuant to a merger or other successor in interest which shall not require the written consent of the Borrower) or otherwise. Upon such assignment, all references to Funding Lender in this Borrower Loan Agreement and in any Borrower Loan Document shall be deemed to refer to such assignee or successor in interest and such assignee or successor in interest shall thereafter stand in the place of the Funding Lender. Borrower shall accord full recognition to any such assignment, and all rights and remedies of Funding Lender in connection with the interest so assigned shall be as fully enforceable by such assignee as they were by Funding Lender before such assignment. In connection with any proposed assignment, Funding Lender may disclose to the proposed assignee any information that Borrower has delivered, or caused to be delivered, to Funding Lender with reference to Borrower, General Partner, any Guarantor or any Affiliate of Borrower, or the Project, including information that Borrower is required to deliver to Funding Lender pursuant to this Borrower Loan Agreement, provided that such proposed assignee agrees to treat such information as confidential. The Borrower may not assign its rights, interests or obligations under this Borrower Loan Agreement or under any of the Borrower Loan Documents or Funding Loan Documents, or Borrower's interest in any moneys to be disbursed or advanced hereunder, except only as may be expressly permitted hereby and by the Construction Funding Agreement.

Section 10.11. Omitted.
Section 10.12. Governmental Lender, Funding Lender and Servicer Not in Control; No Partnership. None of the covenants or other provisions contained in this Borrower Loan Agreement shall, or shall be deemed to, give the Governmental Lender, the Funding Lender or the Servicer the right or power to exercise control over the affairs or management of the Borrower, the power of the Governmental Lender, the Funding Lender and the Servicer being limited to the rights to exercise the remedies referred to in the Borrower Loan Documents and the Funding Loan Documents. The relationship between the Borrower and the Governmental Lender, the Funding Lender and the Servicer is, and at all times shall remain, solely that of debtor and creditor. No covenant or provision of the Borrower Loan Documents or the Funding Loan Documents is intended, nor shall it be deemed or construed, to create a partnership, joint venture, agency or common interest in profits or income between the Borrower and the Governmental Lender, the Funding Lender or the Servicer or to create an equity in the Project in the Governmental Lender, the Funding Lender or the Servicer. Neither the Governmental Lender, the Funding Lender nor the Servicer undertakes or assumes any responsibility or duty to the Borrower or to any other person with respect to the Project or the Borrower Loan, except as expressly provided in the Borrower Loan Documents or the Funding Loan Documents; and notwithstanding any other provision of the Borrower Loan Documents and the Funding Loan Documents: (1) the Governmental Lender, the Funding Lender and the Servicer are not, and shall not be construed as, a partner, joint venturer, alter ego, manager, controlling person or other business associate or participant of any kind of the Borrower or its stockholders, members, or partners and the Governmental Lender, the Funding Lender and the Servicer do not intend to ever assume such status; (2) the Governmental Lender, the Funding Lender and the Servicer shall in no event be liable for any the Borrower Payment Obligations, expenses or losses incurred or sustained by the Borrower; and (3) the Governmental Lender, the Funding Lender and the Servicer shall not be deemed responsible for or a participant in any acts, omissions or decisions of the Borrower, the Borrower Controlling Entities or its stockholders, members, or partners. The Governmental Lender, the Funding Lender and the Servicer and the Borrower disclaim any intention to create any partnership, joint venture, agency or common interest in profits or income between the Governmental Lender, the Funding Lender, the Servicer and the Borrower, or to create an equity in the Project in the Funding Lender or the Servicer, or any sharing of liabilities, losses, costs or expenses.

Section 10.13. Release. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that it is executing this Borrower Loan Agreement and each of the Borrower Loan Documents and the Funding Loan Documents to which it is a party as its own voluntary act free from duress and undue influence.

Section 10.14. Term of Borrower Loan Agreement. This Borrower Loan Agreement shall be in full force and effect until all payment obligations of the Borrower hereunder have been paid in full and the Borrower Loan and the Funding Loan have been retired or the payment thereof has been provided for; except that on and after payment in full of the Borrower Note, this Borrower Loan Agreement shall be terminated, without further action by the parties hereto; provided, however, that the obligations of the Borrower under Sections 5.11 (Governmental Lender's Fees), 5.14 (Expenses), 5.15 (Indemnity), 9.1.3, 9.1.4, 9.1.5, 9.1.6 and 10.15 (Reimbursement of Expenses) hereof, as well as under [Section 5.7] of the Construction Funding Agreement, shall survive the termination of this Borrower Loan Agreement.

Section 10.15. Reimbursement of Expenses. If, upon or after the occurrence of any Event of Default or Potential Default, the Governmental Lender, the Funding Lender or the Servicer shall employ attorneys or incur other expenses for the enforcement of performance or observance of any obligation or agreement on the part of the Borrower contained herein, the Borrower will on demand therefor reimburse the Governmental Lender, the Funding Lender and the Servicer for fees of such attorneys and such other expenses so incurred.

The Borrower's obligation to pay the amounts required to be paid under this Section 10.15 shall be subordinate to its obligations to make payments under the Borrower Note.
Section 10.16. Permitted Contests. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Borrower Loan Agreement, Borrower shall have the right to contest or object in good faith to any claim, demand, levy or assessment (other than in respect of Debt or Contractual Obligations of Borrower under any Borrower Loan Document or Related Document) by appropriate legal proceedings that are not prejudicial to Funding Lender's rights, but this shall not be deemed or construed as in any way relieving, modifying or providing any extension of time with respect to Borrower's covenant to pay and comply with any such claim, demand, levy or assessment, unless Borrower shall have given prior Written Notice to the Governmental Lender and the Funding Lender of Borrower's intent to so contest or object thereto, and unless (i) Borrower has, in the Governmental Lender's and the Funding Lender's judgment, a reasonable basis for such contest, (ii) Borrower pays when due any portion of the claim, demand, levy or assessment to which Borrower does not object, (iii) Borrower demonstrates to Funding Lender's satisfaction that such legal proceedings shall conclusively operate to prevent enforcement prior to final determination of such proceedings, (iv) Borrower furnishes such bond, surety, undertaking or other security in connection therewith as required by law, or as requested by and satisfactory to Funding Lender, to stay such proceeding, which bond, surety, undertaking or other security shall be issued by a bonding company, insurer or surety company reasonably satisfactory to Funding Lender and shall be sufficient to cause the claim, demand, levy or assessment to be insured against by the Title Company or removed as a lien against the Project, (v) Borrower at all times prosecutes the contest with due diligence, and (vi) Borrower pays, promptly following a determination of the amount of such claim, demand, levy or assessment due and owing by Borrower, the amount so determined to be due and owing by Borrower. In the event that Borrower does not make, promptly following a determination of the amount of such claim, demand, levy or assessment due and owing by Borrower, any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (vi) of the preceding sentence, an Event of Default shall have occurred, and Funding Lender may draw or realize upon any bond or other security delivered to Funding Lender in connection with the contest by Borrower, in order to make such payment.

Section 10.17. Funding Lender Approval of Instruments and Parties. All proceedings taken in accordance with transactions provided for herein, and all surveys, appraisals and documents required or contemplated by this Borrower Loan Agreement and the persons responsible for the execution and preparation thereof, shall be satisfactory to and subject to approval by Funding Lender. Funding Lender's approval of any matter in connection with the Project shall be for the sole purpose of protecting the security and rights of Funding Lender. No such approval shall result in a waiver of any default of Borrower. In no event shall Funding Lender's approval be a representation of any kind with regard to the matter being approved.

Section 10.18. Funding Lender Determination of Facts. Funding Lender shall at all times be free to establish independently, to its reasonable satisfaction, the existence or nonexistence of any fact or facts, the existence or nonexistence of which is a condition of this Borrower Loan Agreement.

Section 10.19. Calendar Months. With respect to any payment or obligation that is due or required to be performed within a specified number of Calendar Months after a specified date, such payment or obligation shall become due on the day in the last of such specified number of Calendar Months that corresponds numerically to the date so specified; provided, however, that with respect to any obligation as to which such specified date is the 29th, 30th or 31st day of any Calendar Month: if the Calendar Month in which such payment or obligation would otherwise become due does not have a numerically corresponding date, such obligation shall become due on the first day of the next succeeding Calendar Month.

Section 10.20. Determinations by Lender. Except to the extent expressly set forth in this Borrower Loan Agreement to the contrary, in any instance where the consent or approval of the Governmental Lender and the Funding Lender may be given or is required, or where any determination,
judgment or decision is to be rendered by the Governmental Lender and the Funding Lender under this Borrower Loan Agreement, the granting, withholding or denial of such consent or approval and the rendering of such determination, judgment or decision shall be made or exercised by the Governmental Lender and the Funding Lender, as applicable (or its designated representative) at its sole and exclusive option and in its sole and absolute discretion.

ARTICLE XI
LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY

Section 11.1. Limitation on Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the liability of the Borrower hereunder and under the other Borrower Loan Documents and the Funding Loan Documents shall be limited to the extent set forth in the Borrower Note.

Section 11.2. Limitation on Liability of Governmental Lender. The Funding Loan, and interest thereon, are special, limited obligations of the Governmental Lender, payable solely from the Security pledged under the Funding Loan Agreement. The Funding Loan is not a general indebtedness of the Governmental Lender or a charge against its general credit or the general credit taxing powers of the State, the Governmental Lender, or any other political subdivision thereof, and shall never give rise to any personal pecuniary liability of the Governmental Lender, and neither the Governmental Lender, the State nor any other political subdivision thereof shall be liable for the payments of principal and interest on the Funding Loan, and the Funding Loan is payable from no source other than the Security, and are special,
limited obligations of the Governmental Lender, payable solely out of the Security pledged hereunder and receipts of the Governmental Lender derived pursuant to this Funding Loan Agreement (and not against any money due or to become due to the Governmental Lender pursuant to the exercise or enforcement of Unassigned Rights). No holder of the Funding Loan or any interest therein has the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the State, the Governmental Lender or any other political subdivision thereof to pay the Funding Loan or the interest thereon.

No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or the interest on the Funding Loan or for any claim based thereon or any obligation, covenant or agreement in this Funding Loan Agreement against any official of the Governmental Lender, or any official, officer, agent, employee or independent contractor of the Governmental Lender or any person executing this Borrower Loan Agreement.

Section 11.3. Waiver of Personal Liability.

Section 11.4. Limitation on Liability of Funding Lender’s Officers, Employees, Etc.

(a) Borrower assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of the Governmental Lender and the Funding Lender (except to the extent that such acts or omissions constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct), provided, however, this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude Borrower from pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the Governmental Lender and the Funding Lender at law or under any other agreement. None of Governmental Lender and the Funding Lender, nor the other Beneficiary Parties or their respective officers, directors, employees or agents shall be liable or responsible for (i) for any acts or omissions of the Governmental Lender and the Funding Lender; or (ii) the validity, sufficiency or genuineness of any documents, or endorsements, even if such documents should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Governmental Lender and the Funding Lender may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, unless acceptance in light of such notice or information constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Governmental Lender and the Funding Lender.

(b) None of the Governmental Lender the Funding Lender, the other Beneficiary Parties or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents shall be liable to any contractor, subcontractor, supplier, laborer, architect, engineer or any other party for services performed or materials supplied in connection with the Project.

Neither the Governmental Lender nor the Funding Lender is a joint venture partner with Borrower in any manner whatsoever. Prior to default by Borrower under this Borrower Loan Agreement and the exercise of remedies granted herein, the Governmental Lender and the Funding Lender shall not be
deemed to be in privity of contract with any contractor or provider of services to the Project, nor shall any payment of funds directly to a contractor, subcontractor or provider of services be deemed to create any third-party beneficiary status or recognition of same by the Governmental Lender and the Funding Lender. Approvals granted by the Governmental Lender and the Funding Lender for any matters covered under this Borrower Loan Agreement shall be narrowly construed to cover only the parties and facts identified in any written approval or, if not in writing, such approvals shall be solely for the benefit of Borrower.

(c) Any obligation or liability whatsoever of the Governmental Lender and the Funding Lender that may arise at any time under this Borrower Loan Agreement or any other Borrower Loan Document shall be satisfied, if at all, out of the Funding Lender's assets only. No such obligation or liability shall be personally binding upon, nor shall resort for the enforcement thereof be had to, the Project or any of the Governmental Lender's or the Funding Lender's shareholders (if any), directors, officers, employees or agents, regardless of whether such obligation or liability is in the nature of contract, tort or otherwise.

(d) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Borrower agrees not to assert, and hereby waives, in any legal action or other proceeding, any claim against Funding Lender, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential, special, exemplary or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Borrower Loan Agreement, any other Borrower Loan Document, the Borrower Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.

THIS LAND USE RESTRICTION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), entered into as of ___ 1, 2025 between the CITY OF CHICAGO, a municipal corporation and home rule unit of local government duly organized and validly existing under the Constitution and laws of the State of Illinois (the "Issuer"), and HPUMC REDEVELOPMENT LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, an Illinois limited partnership (the "Borrower"),

WITNESS ETH:

WHEREAS, pursuant to a Funding Loan Agreement, dated as of ____ 1, 2025 (the "Funding Loan Agreement") between the Issuer and BMO Bank, N. A. (the "Funding Lender"), and an ordinance adopted by the Issuer on January ___, 2025 (the "Ordinance"), the Funding Lender will advance funds (the "Funding Loan") in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding Ten Million and 00/100 Dollars ($10,000,000) and the Issuer will issue, sell and deliver its not to exceed $10,000,000 Multi-Family Housing Revenue Note (Humboldt Park Project), Series 2025 (the "Note"), evidencing the obligation to repay the Funding Loan; and

WHEREAS, the Humboldt Park United Methodist Church, Inc., an Illinois not-for-profit corporation (the "Corporation"), is the owner of the real property located at 2120-28 N. Mozart Street and 2847 W. Shakespeare Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60647 (the "Property"); and

WHEREAS, the Corporation is expected to sell the Property to the Latin United Community Housing Association, an Illinois not-for-profit corporation ("LUCHA"), and LUCHA will then sell the Property to the Borrower; and

WHEREAS, the Borrower, 2120 Mozart LLC, an Illinois limited liability company (the "General Partner"), the general partner of the Borrower, and LUCHA, the sole member of the General Partner, have proposed to purchase the Property in the manner described above, for the renovation and adaptive reuse of the existing Humboldt Park United Methodist Church, being the construction, furnishing and equipping of a low income housing project consisting of a three story apartment building that will contain 22 rental dwelling units, comprised of 8 studios, 8 1-bedroom apartments, 3 2-bedroom apartments and 3 3-bedroom apartments, with 5 apartments expected to be set aside as permanent supportive housing units (including related common areas, the "Project"); and

WHEREAS, the proceeds derived from the issuance and sale of the Note have been lent by the Issuer to the Borrower pursuant to a Loan Agreement of even date herewith (the "Borrower Loan Agreement"), between the Issuer and the Borrower for the purpose of financing a portion of the costs of the Project to be owned by the Borrower; and

WHEREAS, in order to assure the Issuer and the Funding Lender that interest on the Note will be excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and to further the public purposes of the Issuer, certain restrictions on the use and occupancy of the Project under the Code must be established:
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants hereinafter set forth, and of other good and valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Borrower and the Issuer agree as follows:

Section 1. Term of Restrictions

(a) **Occupancy Restrictions.** Subject to Revenue Procedure 2004-39, the term of the Occupancy Restrictions set forth in Section 3 hereof shall commence on the first day on which at least 10% of the Units are first occupied following completion of such Units and shall end on the latest of (i) the date which is 15 years after the date on which at least 50% of the Units in the Project are first occupied; or (ii) the first date on which no tax-exempt note or bond (including any refunding note or bond) issued with respect to the Project is outstanding (treating, for such purpose, the Project as being financed in part by the Note) (which period is hereinafter referred with respect to the Project as the "Qualified Project Period").

(b) **Rental Restrictions.** The Rental Restrictions with respect to the Project set forth in Section 4 hereof shall remain in effect during the Qualified Project Period.

(c) **Involuntary Loss or Substantial Destruction.** The Occupancy Restrictions set forth in Section 3 hereof, and the Rental Restrictions set forth in Section 4 hereof, shall cease to apply to the Project in the event of involuntary noncompliance caused by fire, seizure, requisition, foreclosure, transfer of title by deed in lieu of foreclosure, change in federal law or an action of a federal agency (with respect to the Project) after the date of delivery of the Note, which prevents the Issuer from enforcing the Occupancy Restrictions and the Rental Restrictions (with respect to the Project), or condemnation or similar event (with respect to the Project), but only if, within a reasonable time, (i) the Note is promptly repaid, or amounts received as a consequence of such event are used to provide a new project which meets all of the requirements of this Agreement, which new project is subject to new restrictions substantially equivalent to those contained in this Agreement, and which is substituted in place of the Project by amendment of this Agreement; and (ii) an opinion from nationally recognized bond counsel (selected by the Issuer) is received to the effect that noncompliance with the Occupancy Restrictions and the Rental Restrictions applicable to the Project as a result of such involuntary loss or substantial destruction resulting from an unforeseen event with respect to the Project will not adversely affect the exclusion of the interest on the Note from the gross income of the owner thereof for purposes of federal income taxation; provided, however, that the preceding provisions of this paragraph shall cease to apply in the case of such involuntary noncompliance caused by foreclosure, transfer of title by deed in lieu of foreclosure or similar event if at any time during the Qualified Project Period with respect to the Project subsequent to such event the Borrower or any Affiliated Party (as hereinafter defined) obtains an ownership interest in the Project for federal income tax purposes. "Affiliated Party" means a person whose relationship to another person is such that (i) the relationship between such persons would result in a disallowance of losses under Section 267 or 707(b) of the Code; or (ii) such persons are members of the same controlled group of corporations (as defined in Section 1563(a) of the Code, except that "more than 50%" shall be substituted for "at least 80%" each place it appears therein).
(d) **Termination.** This Agreement shall terminate with respect to the Project upon the earliest of (i) termination of the Occupancy Restrictions and the Rental Restrictions with respect to the Project, as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 1; or (ii) delivery to the Issuer and the Borrower of an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel (selected by the Issuer) to the effect that continued compliance of the Project with the Rental Restrictions and the Occupancy Restrictions applicable to the Project is not required in order for interest on the Note to remain excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes.

(e) **Certification.** Upon termination of this Agreement, the Borrower and the Issuer shall execute and cause to be recorded (at the Borrower's expense), in all offices in which this Agreement was recorded, a certificate of termination, specifying which of the restrictions contained herein has terminated.

(f) **Encumbrance of Fee.** In furtherance of enforcing compliance with the provisions of Section 142(d) of the Code and Section 1.103-8(b) of the Regulations (defined below) applicable to this Agreement, unless the provisions of paragraph (c) or (d) above apply to the Project resulting in a termination of the restrictions set forth herein, such restrictions shall continue to apply to the Project following the termination of the Borrower's or any other party's interest, whether or not the lien of the mortgage with respect to the Project is thereafter released by the Issuer.

**Section 2. Project Restrictions**

The Borrower represents, warrants and covenants that:

(a) The Borrower has reviewed the provisions of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (the "Regulations") applicable to this Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 142(d) of the Code and Section 1.103-8(b) of the Regulations) with its counsel and understands said provisions.

(b) The Project is being acquired, constructed and equipped for the purpose of providing a "qualified residential rental project" (as such phrase is used in Section 142(d) of the Code) and will, during the term of the Rental Restrictions and Occupancy Restrictions hereunder applicable to the Project, continue to constitute a "qualified residential rental project" under Section 142(d) of the Code and any Regulations heretofore or hereafter promulgated thereunder and applicable thereto.

(c) Substantially all (not less than 95%) of the Project will consist of a "building or structure" (as defined in Section 1.103-8(b)(8)(iv) of the Regulations), or several proximate buildings or structures, of similar construction, each containing one or more similarly constructed residential units (as defined in Section 1.103-8(b)(8)(i) of the Regulations) located on a single tract of land or contiguous tracts of land (as defined in Section 1.103-8(b)(4)(ii)-(B) of the Regulations), which will be owned, for federal tax purposes, at all times by the same person, and financed pursuant to a common plan (within the meaning of Section 1.103-8(b)(4)(ii) of the Regulations), together with functionally related and subordinate facilities (within the meaning of Section 1.103-8(b)(4)(iii) of the Regulations). If any such building or structure contains fewer than five (5) units, no unit in such building or structure shall be occupied by the Borrower or an agent or employee of the Borrower.
(d) None of the Units in the Project will at any time be used on a transient basis, and no portion of the Project will be used as a hotel, motel, dormitory, fraternity or sorority house, rooming house, hospital, nursing home, sanitarium, rest home or trailer park or court for use on a transient basis; further, no portion of the Project shall be operated as an assisted living facility which provides continual or frequent nursing, medical or psychiatric services; provided, however that nothing herein shall be understood to prohibit single-room-occupancy units occupied under month-to-month leases.

(e) All of the Units in the Project will be leased or rented, or available for lease or rental, on a continuous basis to members of the general public (other than (i) Units for resident managers or maintenance personnel, (ii) Units for Qualifying Tenants as provided for in Section 3 hereof, (iii) Units set aside as Permanent Supportive Housing Units, and (iv) Units which may be rented under the Section 8 assistance program, which units (subject to the Section 8 assistance program) shall be leased to eligible tenants in accordance with Section 8 requirements), subject, however, to the requirements of Section 3(a) hereof. Each Qualifying Tenant (as hereinafter defined) occupying a Unit in the Project shall be required to execute a written lease with a stated term of not less than 30 days nor more than one year.

(f) Any functionally related and subordinate facilities (e.g., parking areas, swimming pools, tennis courts, etc.) which are included as part of the Project will be of a character and size commensurate with the character and size of the Project, and will be made available to all tenants in the Project on an equal basis; fees will only be charged with respect to the use thereof if the charging of fees is customary for the use of such facilities at similar residential rental properties in the surrounding area (i.e., within a one-mile radius), or, if none, then within comparable urban settings in the City of Chicago, and then only in amounts commensurate with the fees being charged at similar residential rental properties within such area. In any event, any fees charged will not be discriminatory or exclusionary as to the Qualifying Tenants (as defined in Section 3 hereof). No functionally related and subordinate facilities will be made available to persons other than tenants or their guests.

(g) Each residential unit in the Project will contain separate and complete facilities for living, sleeping, eating, cooking and sanitation for a single person or family.

(h) No portion of the Project will be used to provide any health club facility (except as provided in (f) above), any facility primarily used for gambling, or any store, the principal business of which is the sale of alcoholic beverages for consumption off premises, in violation of Section 147(e) of the Code.

Section 3. Occupancy Restrictions

The Borrower represents, warrants and covenants with respect to the Project that:

(a) Pursuant to the election of the Issuer in accordance with the provisions of Section 142(d)(1)(A) of the Code, at all times during the Qualified Project Period with respect to the Project at least 40% of the completed Units in the Project shall be continuously occupied (or treated as occupied as provided herein) or held available for occupancy by Qualifying Tenants as herein defined. For purposes of this Agreement, "Qualifying Tenants" means individuals or families whose aggregate adjusted incomes do not exceed 60% of the applicable median gross income
(adjusted for family size) for the area in which the Project is located, as such income and area median gross income are determined by the Secretary of the United States Treasury in a manner consistent with determinations of income and area median gross income under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended (or, if such program is terminated, under such program as in effect immediately before such determination).

(b) Prior to the commencement of occupancy of any unit to be occupied by a Qualifying Tenant, the prospective tenant's eligibility shall be established by execution and delivery by such prospective tenant of an Income Computation and Certification in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Income Certification") evidencing that the aggregate adjusted income of such prospective tenant does not exceed the applicable income limit. In addition, such prospective tenant shall be required to provide whatever other information, documents or certifications are reasonably deemed necessary by the Borrower or the Issuer to substantiate the Income Certification.

(c) Not less frequently than annually, the Borrower shall determine whether the current aggregate adjusted income of each tenant occupying any unit being treated by the Borrower as occupied by a Qualifying Tenant exceeds the applicable income limit. For such purpose the Borrower shall require each such tenant to execute and deliver the Income Certification; provided, however, that for any calendar year during which no unit in the Project is occupied by a new resident who is not a qualifying tenant, no Income Computation and Certification for existing tenants shall be required.

(d) Any unit vacated by a Qualifying Tenant shall be treated as continuing to be occupied by such tenant until reoccupied, other than for a temporary period not to exceed 31 days, at which time the character of such unit as a unit occupied by a Qualifying Tenant shall be redetermined.

(e) If an individual's or family's income exceeds the applicable income limit as of any date of determination, the income of such individual or family shall be treated as continuing not to exceed the applicable limit, provided that the income of an individual or family did not exceed the applicable income limit upon commencement of such tenant's occupancy or as of any prior income determination, and provided, further, that if any individual's or family's income as of the most recent income determination exceeds 140% of the applicable income limit, such individual or family shall cease to qualify as a Qualifying Tenant if, prior to the next income determination of such individual or family, any unit in the Project of comparable or smaller size to such individual's or family's unit is occupied by any tenant other than a Qualifying Tenant.

(f) The lease to be utilized by the Borrower in renting any Unit in the Project to a prospective Qualifying Tenant shall provide for termination of the lease and consent by such person to eviction following 30 days' written notice, subject to applicable provisions of Illinois law (including for such purpose all applicable home rule ordinances), for any material misrepresentation made by such person with respect to the Income Certification with the effect that such tenant is not a Qualified Tenant.
(g) All Income Certifications will be maintained on file at the Project as long as the Note is outstanding and for five years thereafter with respect to each Qualifying Tenant who occupied a Unit in the Project during the period the restrictions hereunder are applicable, and the Borrower will, promptly upon receipt, file a copy thereof with the Issuer.

(h) On the first day of the Qualified Project Period with respect to the Project, on the fifteenth days of January, April, July and October of each year during the Qualified Project Period with respect to the Project, and within 30 days after the final day of each month in which there occurs any change in the occupancy of a Unit in the Project, the Borrower will submit to the Issuer a “Certificate of Continuing Program Compliance,” in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C executed by the Borrower with respect to the Project.

(i) The Borrower shall submit to the Secretary of the United States Treasury (at such time and in such manner as the Secretary shall prescribe) with respect to the Project an annual certification on Form 8703 as to whether the Project continues to meet the requirements of Section 142(d) of the Code. Failure to comply with such requirement may subject the Borrower to the penalty provided in Section 6652(j) of the Code.

Section 4. [Reserved]

Section 5. Transfer Restrictions

The Borrower covenants and agrees that no conveyance, transfer, assignment or any other disposition of title to any portion of the Project (a “Transfer”) shall be made prior to the termination of the Rental Restrictions and Occupancy Restrictions hereunder with respect to the Project, unless the transferee pursuant to the Transfer assumes in writing (the “Assumption Agreement”), in a form reasonably acceptable to the Issuer, all of the executory duties and obligations hereunder of the Borrower with respect to such portion of the Project, including those contained in this Section 5, and agrees to cause any subsequent transferee to assume such duties and obligations in the event of a subsequent Transfer by the transferee prior to the termination of the Rental Restrictions and Occupancy Restrictions hereunder with respect to the Project. The Borrower shall deliver the Assumption Agreement to the Issuer at least 30 days prior to a proposed Transfer. This Section 5 shall not apply to any involuntary transfer pursuant to Section 1(c) hereof. This Section shall not be deemed to restrict the transfer of any partnership interest in the Borrower or a transfer by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure.

Section 6. Enforcement

(a) Upon reasonable notice and during regular business hours, the Borrower shall permit all duly authorized representatives of the Issuer to inspect any books and records of the Borrower regarding the Project and the incomes of Qualifying Tenants which pertain to compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and Section 142(d) of the Code and the regulations heretofore or hereafter promulgated thereunder.

(b) In addition to the information provided for in Section 3(i) hereof, the Borrower shall submit any other information, documents or certifications reasonably requested by the Issuer, which the Issuer deems reasonably necessary to substantiate continuing compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and Section 142(d) of the Code and the regulations heretofore or hereafter promulgated thereunder.
(c) The Issuer and the Borrower each covenant that it will not take or permit to be taken any action within its control that it knows would adversely affect the excludability of interest on the Note from the gross income of the owners thereof for purposes of federal income taxation pursuant to Section 103 of the Code. Moreover, each covenants to take any lawful action within its control (including amendment of this Agreement as may be necessary in the opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel selected by the Issuer) to comply fully with all applicable rules, rulings, policies, procedures, regulations or other official statements promulgated or proposed by the Department of the Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service from time to time pertaining to obligations issued under Section 142(d) of the Code and affecting the Project.

(d) The Borrower covenants and agrees to inform the Issuer by written notice of any violation of its obligations hereunder within five days of first discovering any such violation. If any such violation is not corrected to the satisfaction of the Issuer within the period of time specified by the Issuer, which shall be (i) the lesser of (A) 60 days after the effective date of any notice to or from the Borrower, or (B) 75 days from the date such violation would have been discovered by the Borrower by the exercise of reasonable diligence, or (ii) such longer period as may be necessary to cure such violation, provided bond counsel (selected by the Issuer) of nationally recognized standing in matters pertaining to the exclusion of interest on municipal bonds from gross income for purposes of federal income taxation issues an opinion that such extension will not result in the loss of such exclusion of interest on the Note, without further notice, the Issuer shall declare a default under this Agreement effective on the date of such declaration of default, and the Issuer shall apply to any, court, state or federal, for specific performance of this Agreement or an injunction against any violation of this Agreement, or any other remedies at law or in equity or any such other actions as shall be necessary or desirable so as to correct noncompliance with this Agreement.

(e) The Borrower and the Issuer each acknowledges that the primary purposes for requiring compliance with the restrictions provided in this Agreement are to preserve the excludability of interest on the Note from gross income for purposes of federal income taxation, and that the Issuer, on behalf of the owners of the Note, who are declared to be third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement, shall be entitled for any breach of the provisions hereof, to all remedies both at law and in equity in the event of any default hereunder.

(f) In the enforcement of this Agreement, the Issuer may rely on any certificate delivered by or on behalf of the Borrower or any tenant with respect to the Project.

(g) Nothing in this Section shall preclude the Issuer from exercising any remedies it might otherwise have, by contract, statute or otherwise, upon the occurrence of any violation hereunder.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Issuer hereby agrees that any cure of any default made or tendered by one or more of the Borrower's partners shall be deemed to be a cure by the Borrower and shall be accepted or rejected on the same basis as if made or tendered by the Borrower.

SECTION 10. DEVELOPER PARTIES' EMPLOYMENT OBLIGATIONS

10.01 Employment Opportunity. Owner, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, hereby agrees, and shall contractually obligate its or their various contractors, subcontractors or any Affiliate of Owner operating on the Property (collectively, with Owner, the "Employers" and individually an "Employer") to agree, that for the Term of the Agreement with respect to Owner and during the period of any other party's provision of services in connection with the construction of the Project or occupation of the Property:

(a) No Employer shall discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment based upon race, religion, color, sex, national origin or ancestry, age, handicap or disability, sexual orientation, military discharge status, marital status, parental status or source of income as defined in the City of Chicago Human Rights Ordinance, Chapter 2-160, Section 2-160-010 et seq., Municipal Code, except as otherwise provided by said ordinance and as amended from time to time (the "Human Rights Ordinance"). Each Employer shall take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are hired and employed without discrimination based upon race, religion, color, sex, national origin or ancestry, age, handicap or disability, sexual orientation, military discharge status, marital status, parental status or source of income and are treated in a non-discriminatory manner with regard to all job-related matters, including without limitation: employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training, including apprenticeship. Each Employer agrees to post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for employment, notices to be provided by the City setting forth the provisions of this nondiscrimination clause. In
addition, the Employers, in all solicitations or advertisements for employees, shall state that all qualified applicants shall receive consideration for employment without discrimination based upon race, religion, color, sex, national origin or ancestry, age, handicap or disability, sexual orientation, military discharge status, marital status, parental status or source of income.

(b) To the greatest extent feasible, each Employer is required to present opportunities for training and employment of low- and moderate-income residents of the City and preferably of the Redevelopment Area; and to provide that contracts for work in connection with the construction of the Project be awarded to business concerns that are located in, or owned in substantial part by persons residing in, the City and preferably in the Redevelopment Area.

(c) Each Employer shall comply with all federal, state and local equal employment and affirmative action statutes, rules and regulations, including but not limited to the City's Human Rights Ordinance and the Illinois Human Rights Act, 775 ILCS 5/1-101 et seq. (1993), and any subsequent amendments and regulations promulgated thereto.

(d) Each Employer, in order to demonstrate compliance with the terms of this Section, shall cooperate with and promptly and accurately respond to inquiries by the City, which has the responsibility to observe and report compliance with equal employment opportunity regulations of federal, state and municipal agencies.

(e) Each Employer shall include the foregoing provisions of subparagraphs (a) through (d) in every contract entered into in connection with the Project and shall require inclusion of these provisions in every subcontract entered into by any subcontractors, and every agreement with any Affiliate operating on the Property, so that each such provision shall be binding upon each contractor, subcontractor or Affiliate, as the case may be.

(f) Failure to comply with the employment obligations described in this Section 10.01 shall be a basis for the City to pursue remedies under the provisions of Section 15.02, subject to the cure rights under Section 15.03.

10.02 City Resident Construction Worker Employment Requirement. Owner agrees for itself and its successors and assigns, and shall contractually obligate its General Contractor and shall cause the General Contractor to contractually obligate its subcontractors, as applicable, to agree, that during the construction of the Project they shall comply with the minimum percentage of total worker hours performed by actual residents of the City as specified in Section 2-92-330 of the Municipal Code (at least 50 percent of the total worker hours worked by persons on the site of the Project shall be performed by actual residents of the City); provided, however, that in addition to complying with this percentage, Owner, its General Contractor and each subcontractor shall be required to make good faith efforts to utilize qualified residents of the City in both unskilled and skilled labor positions.

Owner may request a reduction or waiver of this minimum percentage level of Chicagoans as provided for in Section 2-92-330 of the Municipal Code in accordance with standards and procedures developed by the Chief Procurement Officer of the City.

"Actual residents of the City" means persons domiciled within the City. The domicile is an individual's one and only true, fixed and permanent home and principal establishment.
Owner, the General Contractor and each subcontractor shall provide for the maintenance of adequate employee residency records to show that actual Chicago residents are employed on the Project. Each Employer shall maintain copies of personal documents supportive of every Chicago employee's actual record of residence.

Weekly certified payroll reports (U.S. Department of Labor Form WH-347 or equivalent) shall be submitted to the Commissioner of DPD in triplicate, which shall identify clearly the actual residence of every employee on each submitted certified payroll. The first time that an employee's name appears on a payroll, the date that the Employer hired the employee should be written in after the employee's name.

Upon 2 business days prior written notice, Owner, the General Contractor and each subcontractor shall provide full access to their employment records to the Chief Procurement Officer, the Commissioner of DPD, the Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department, the Inspector General or any duly authorized representative of any of them. Owner, the General Contractor and each subcontractor shall maintain all relevant personnel data and records for a period of at least three (3) years after final acceptance of the work constituting the Project.

At the direction of DPD, affidavits and other supporting documentation will be required of Owner, the General Contractor and each subcontractor to verify or clarify an employee's actual address when doubt or lack of clarity has arisen.

Good faith efforts on the part of Owner, the General Contractor and each subcontractor to provide utilization of actual Chicago residents (but not sufficient for the granting of a waiver request as provided for in the standards and procedures developed by the Chief Procurement Officer) shall not suffice to replace the actual, verified achievement of the requirements of this Section concerning the worker hours performed by actual Chicago residents.

When work at the Project is completed, in the event that the City has determined that Owner has failed to ensure the fulfillment of the requirement of this Section concerning the worker hours performed by actual Chicago residents or failed to report in the manner as indicated above, the City will thereby be damaged in the failure to provide the benefit of demonstrable employment to Chicagoans to the degree stipulated in this Section. Therefore, in such a case of non-compliance, it is agreed that 1/20 of 1 percent (0.0005) of the aggregate hard construction costs set forth in the Project budget (the product of .0005 x such aggregate hard construction costs) (as the same shall be evidenced by approved contract value for the actual contracts) shall be surrendered by Owner to the City in payment for each percentage of shortfall toward the stipulated residency requirement. Failure to report the residency of employees entirely and correctly shall result in the surrender of the entire liquidated damages as if no Chicago residents were employed in either of the categories. The willful falsification of statements and the certification of payroll data may subject Owner, the General Contractor and/or the subcontractors to prosecution. Any retainage to cover contract performance that may become due to Owner pursuant to Section 2-92-250 of the Municipal Code may be withheld by the City pending the Chief Procurement Officer's determination as to whether Owner must surrender damages as provided in this paragraph.

Nothing herein provided shall be construed to be a limitation upon the "Notice of Requirements for Affirmative Action to Ensure Equal Employment Opportunity, Executive Order 11246" and "Standard Federal Equal Employment Opportunity, Executive Order 11246," or other
affirmative action required for equal opportunity under the provisions of this Agreement or related documents.

Owner shall cause or require the provisions of this Section 10.02 to be included in all construction contracts and subcontracts related to the Project.

10.03. MBE/WBE Commitment. Owner agrees for itself and its successors and assigns, and, if necessary to meet the requirements set forth herein, shall contractually obligate the General Contractor to agree that during the Project:

(a) Consistent with the findings which support, as applicable, (i) the Minority-Owned and Women-Owned Business Enterprise Procurement Program, Section 2-92-420 et seq., Municipal Code (the "Procurement Program"), and (ii) the Minority- and Women-Owned Business Enterprise Construction Program, Section 2-92-650 et seq., Municipal Code (the "Construction Program," and collectively with the Procurement Program, the "MBE/WBE Program"), and in reliance upon the provisions of the MBE/WBE Program to the extent contained in, and as qualified by, the provisions of this Section 10.03, during the course of the Project, at least the following percentages of the MBE/WBE Budget (as set forth in Exhibit B) shall be expended for contract participation by MBEs and by WBEs:

2. At least six percent by WBEs.

(c) Consistent with Sections 2-92-440 and 2-92-720, Municipal Code, Owner's MBE/WBE commitment may be achieved in part by Owner's status as an MBE or WBE (but only to the extent of any actual work performed on the Project by Owner) or by a joint venture with one or more MBEs or WBEs (but only to the extent of the lesser of (i) the MBE or WBE participation in such joint venture or (ii) the amount of any actual work performed on the Project by the MBE or WBE), by Owner utilizing a MBE or a WBE as the General Contractor (but only to the extent of any actual work performed on the Project by the General Contractor), by subcontracting or causing the General Contractor to subcontract a portion of the Project to one or more MBEs or WBEs, or by the purchase of materials or services used in the Project from one or more MBEs or WBEs, or by any combination of the foregoing. Those entities which constitute both a MBE and a WBE shall not be credited more than once with regard to Owner's MBE/WBE commitment as described in this Section 10.03. In accordance with Section 2-92-730, Municipal Code, Owner shall not substitute any MBE or WBE General Contractor or subcontractor without the prior written approval of DPD.

(d) Owner shall deliver quarterly reports to the City's monitoring staff during the Project describing its efforts to achieve compliance with this MBE/WBE commitment. Such reports shall include, inter alia, the name and business address of each MBE and WBE solicited by Owner or the General Contractor to work on the Project, and the responses received from such solicitation, the name and business address of each MBE or WBE actually involved in the Project, a
description of the work performed or products or services supplied, the date and amount of such work, product or service, and such other information as may assist the City's monitoring staff in determining Owner's compliance with this MBE/WBE commitment. Owner shall maintain records of all relevant data with respect to the utilization of MBEs and WBEs in connection with the Project for at least five years after completion of the Project, and the City's monitoring staff shall have access to all such records maintained by Owner, on five Business Days' notice, to allow the City to review Owner's compliance with its commitment to MBE/WBE participation and the status of any MBE or WBE performing any portion of the Project.

(e) Upon the disqualification of any MBE or WBE General Contractor or subcontractor, if such status was misrepresented by the disqualified party, Owner shall be obligated to discharge or cause to be discharged the disqualified General Contractor or subcontractor, and, if possible, identify and engage a qualified MBE or WBE as a replacement. For purposes of this subsection (e), the disqualification procedures are further described in Sections 2-92-540 and 2-92-730, Municipal Code, as applicable.

(f) Any reduction or waiver of Owner's MBE/WBE commitment as described in this Section 10.03 shall be undertaken in accordance with Sections 2-92-450 and 2-92-730, Municipal Code, as applicable.

(g) Before starting the Project, Owner shall be required to meet with the City's monitoring staff with regard to Owner's compliance with its obligations under this Section 10.03. The General Contractor and all major subcontractors shall be required to attend this pre-construction meeting. During said meeting, Owner shall demonstrate to the City's monitoring staff its plan to achieve its obligations under this Section 10.03, the sufficiency of which shall be approved by the City's monitoring staff. During the Project, Owner shall submit the documentation required by this Section 10.03 to the City's monitoring staff, including the following: (i) subcontractor's activity report; (ii) contractor's certification concerning labor standards and prevailing wage requirements; (iii) contractor letter of understanding; (iv) monthly utilization report; (v) authorization for payroll agent; (vi) certified payroll; (vii) evidence that MBE/WBE contractor associations have been informed of the Project via written notice and hearings; and (viii) evidence of compliance with job creation/job retention requirements. Failure to submit such documentation on a timely basis, or a determination by the City's monitoring staff, upon analysis of the documentation, that Owner is not complying with its obligations under this Section 10.03, shall, upon the delivery of written notice to Owner, be deemed an Event of Default. Upon the occurrence of any such Event of Default, in addition to any other remedies provided in this Agreement, the City may: (1) issue a written demand to Developer Parties to halt the Project, (2) withhold any further payment of any City Funds to Developer Parties or the General Contractor, or (3) seek any other remedies against Developer Parties available at law or in equity.

Without limiting any other provisions hereof, Owner agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the City harmless from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, injuries, costs, expenses or claims of any kind whatsoever including, without limitation, any losses, liabilities, damages, injuries, costs, expenses or claims asserted or arising under any Environmental Laws incurred, suffered by or asserted against the City as a direct or indirect result of any of the following, regardless of whether or not caused by, or within the control of Owner: (i) the presence of any Hazardous Material on or under, or the escape, seepage, leakage, spillage, emission, discharge or release of any Hazardous Material from (A) all or any portion of the Property or (B) any other real property in which Owner, or any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with Owner, hold any estate or interest whatsoever (including, without limitation, any property owned by a land trust in which the beneficial interest is owned, in whole or in part, by Owner), or (ii) any liens against the Property permitted or imposed by any Environmental Laws, or any actual or asserted liability or obligation of the City or Owner or any of their affiliates under any Environmental Laws relating to the Property.

The Owner provided the City with a Phase I ESA compliant with ASTM E-1527-21 for the Property prior to and conducted, or updated, within 180 days prior to the conveyance of the Property and a Phase II ESA.

The Phase I ESA identified Recognized Environmental Conditions ("RECs") and the Owner performed a Phase II ESA to ascertain the presence of any environmental impacts that may be associated with the RECs.

The Phase II ESA identified contamination above residential remediation objectives as determined by Title 35 of the Illinois Administrative Code ("IAC") Part 742, and the Owner shall enroll the Property (or any portion thereof) in the IEPA SRP in order to obtain a Final Comprehensive Residential NFR Letter for the enrolled Property. The Owner acknowledges and agrees that it may not commence construction on the Property or commence any other activity on the Property that could interfere with the prompt start and completion of the RAP until the IEPA issues a RAP Approval Letter for the Property.

Upon receipt of the RAP Approval Letter for the Property, the Owner covenants and agrees to promptly complete all Remediation Work necessary to obtain a Final Comprehensive Residential NFR Letter for the Property using all reasonable means. The City shall have the right to review in advance and approve all documents submitted to the IEPA under the SRP, as amended or supplemented from time to time, including, without limitation, the SRP Documents and any changes thereto, and the Owner's estimate of the cost to perform the Remediation Work. The Owner shall bear sole responsibility for all costs of the Remediation Work necessary to obtain the Final Comprehensive Residential NFR Letter, and the costs of any other investigative and cleanup costs associated with the Property. The Owner shall promptly transmit to the City copies of all environmental documents prepared or received with respect to the Remediation Work, including, without limitation, any written communications delivered to or received from the IEPA or other regulatory agencies. The Developer Parties acknowledge and agree to not request a certificate of occupancy for the Project from the Department of Buildings until the IEPA has issued, and Developer Parties have recorded with the Cook County Clerk's Office and the City has approved, a Final Comprehensive Residential NFR Letter for the Property (to the extent required), which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. If Developer Parties fail to obtain the Final Comprehensive Residential NFR Letter within six (6) months of the submission of the RACR to
the IEPA, unless the City agreed to extend such time period, then the City shall have the right to issue a notice of default of this Agreement against the Property.

Developer Parties acknowledge that, except in the case of information specifically designated by the Developer Parties to be treated confidentially as a trade secret or secret process, the City may make environmental assessments, hazardous material building surveys, IEPA SRP submittals, or similar environmental documents relating to the property publicly available, and Developer Parties consent to the City's publication of those documents.

The Owner must abide by the terms and conditions of the Final Comprehensive Residential NFR Letter and must inform any subsequent owner and tenants of the Property to abide by the terms of the Final Comprehensive Residential NFR Letter.

(ii) if the Event of Default is of a non-monetary nature, the cure is completed within 30 days after the later of: (a) the expiration of the cure period, if any, granted to Developer Parties with respect to such non-monetary default; or (b) receipt of such notice from the City; provided, however, that if such non-monetary default is not reasonably capable of being cured by the lenders or the Investor Member within such 30-day period, such period shall be extended for such reasonable period of time as may be necessary to cure such default, provided that the party seeking such cure must continue diligently to pursue such cure and, if possession of the Project is necessary to effect such cure, the party seeking such cure must have instituted appropriate legal proceedings to obtain possession.

SECTION 16. MORTGAGING OF THE PROJECT

All mortgages or deeds of trust in place as of the date of this Agreement with respect to the Property or any portion thereof that were made before or on the date of this Agreement in connection with Lender Financing and which are Permitted Liens are referred to in this Agreement as the "Existing Mortgages." Any mortgage or deed of trust that Developer Parties may hereafter elect to execute and record or permit to be recorded against the Property or any portion thereof is referred to in this Agreement as a "New Mortgage." Any New Mortgage that Developer Parties may hereafter elect to execute and record or permit to be recorded against the Property or any portion thereof with the prior written consent of the City is referred to in this Agreement as a "Permitted Mortgage." The City and Developer Parties agree as follows:

(a) If a mortgagee or any other party shall succeed to Developer Parties' interest in the Property or any portion thereof pursuant to the exercise of remedies under a New Mortgage (other than a Permitted Mortgage), whether by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure, and in conjunction therewith accepts an assignment of Developer Parties' interest under this Agreement in accordance with Section 18.14 (Assignment), the City may, but shall not be obligated to, attorn to and recognize such party as the successor in interest to Developer Parties for all purposes under this Agreement and, unless so recognized by the City as the successor in interest, such
party shall be entitled to no rights or benefits under this Agreement, but such party shall be bound by those provisions of this Agreement that are covenants expressly running with the leasehold estate specified in Section 7.02.

(b) If any mortgagee shall succeed to Owner's interest in the Property or any portion thereof pursuant to the exercise of remedies under an Existing Mortgage or a Permitted Mortgage, whether by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure, and in conjunction therewith accepts an assignment of Developer Parties' interest under this Agreement in accordance with Section 18.14 (Assignment), the City hereby agrees to attorn to and recognize such party as the successor in interest to Developer Parties for all purposes under this Agreement so long as such party accepts all of the obligations and liabilities of "Developer Parties" under this Agreement; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, it is understood and agreed that if such party accepts an assignment of Developer Parties' interest under this Agreement, such party has no liability under this Agreement for any Event of Default of Developer Parties which accrued before such party succeeded to the interest of Developer Parties under this Agreement, in which case Developer Parties shall be solely responsible. However, if such mortgagee under a Permitted Mortgage or an Existing Mortgage does not expressly accept an assignment of Developer Parties' interest under this Agreement, such party shall be entitled to no rights and benefits under this Agreement, and such party shall be bound only by those provisions of this Agreement, if any, which are covenants expressly running with the leasehold estate.

(c) Before the City issues a Certificate under Section 7, Developer Parties shall not execute a New Mortgage with respect to the Property or any portion of the Property without the prior written consent of the Commissioner of DPD. After the issuance of a Certificate, consent of the Commissioner of DPD is not required for any such New Mortgage.

No material amendment or change to this Agreement shall be made or be effective unless ratified or authorized by an ordinance duly adopted by the City Council. The term "material" for the purpose of this Section 18.01 shall be defined as any deviation from the terms of the Agreement which operates to cancel or otherwise reduce any developmental, construction or job-creating obligations of Developer Parties (including those set forth in Sections 10.02 and 10.03) by more than five percent (5%) or materially changes the Project site or character of the Project or any activities undertaken by Developer Parties affecting the Project site, the Project, or both, or increases any time agreed for performance by Developer Parties by more than ninety (90) days.

18.02 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including each Exhibit attached to this Agreement, which is hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference) constitutes the entire agreement between the parties to this Agreement and it supersedes all prior agreements, negotiations, and discussions between the parties relative to the subject matter of this Agreement.

18.03 Limitation of Liability. No member, official or employee of the City shall be personally liable to Developer Parties or any successor in interest in the event of any default or breach by the City or for any amount which may become due to Developer Parties from the City or any successor in interest or on any obligation under the terms of this Agreement.

18.04 Further Assurances. Developer Parties agree to take such actions, including the execution and delivery of such documents, instruments, petitions and certifications as may become necessary or appropriate to carry out the terms, provisions and intent of this Agreement.

18.05 Waiver. Waiver by the City or Developer Parties with respect to any breach of this Agreement shall not be considered or treated as a waiver of the rights of the respective party with respect to any other default or with respect to any particular default, except to the extent specifically waived by the City or Developer Parties in writing. No delay or omission on the part of a party in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver of such right or any other right unless pursuant to the specific terms of this Agreement. A waiver by a party of a provision of this Agreement shall not prejudice or constitute a waiver of such party's right otherwise to demand strict compliance with that provision or any other provision of this Agreement. No prior waiver by a party, nor any course of dealing between the parties to this Agreement, shall constitute a waiver of any such parties' rights or of any obligations of any other party to this Agreement as to any future transactions.

[SO2025-0014841]

The Committee on Finance submitted the following report:

CHICAGO, February 19, 2025.

*To the President and Members of the City Council:*

Your Committee on Finance, to which was referred a substitute ordinance authorizing the issuance of general obligation bonds to finance improvements to public rights-of-way, public infrastructure and transportation, loans and grants, acquisition of property, construction and maintenance of public buildings, economic programs and lead service line replacements (SO2025-0014841), having had the same under advisement, begs leave to report and recommend that Your Honorable Body pass the proposed substitute ordinance transmitted herewith.
This recommendation was concurred in by a voice vote of the members of the committee present, with three dissenting votes made by Alderpersons Raymond Lopez (15th Ward), Brian Hopkins (2nd Ward) and William Conway (34th Ward) on February 10, 2025.

Respectfully submitted,

(Signed) PAT DOWELL,
Chair.

Alderperson Conway moved to refer the proposed ordinance back to the Committee on Finance and requested a roll call vote.

Alderperson Dowell moved to lay on the table Alderperson Conway’s motion to refer the ordinance to committee.

Alderperson Lopez stated that the Chair instructed the Clerk to open the vote on the motion to refer the ordinance back to committee and therefore Alderperson Dowell’s motion was out of order.

The Chair stated that the vote on the motion to refer had not commenced and therefore the motion by Alderperson Dowell was appropriate.

Alderperson Lopez appealed the ruling from the Chair.

The Chair ruled that the motion by Alderperson Dowell was made prior to the commencement of a vote on the previous motion by Alderperson Conway and therefore the decision of the Chair stands.

Alderperson Dowell then renewed her motion to lay on the table Alderperson Conway’s motion to refer the ordinance back to the Committee on Finance.

The Clerk called the roll and the motion to lay on the table Prevailed by yeas and nays as follows:

Yeas -- Alderpersons La Spata, Dowell, Robinson, Yancy, Hall, Mitchell, Harris, Ramirez, Gutierrez, Coleman, Taylor, Mosley, Rodriguez, Sigcho-Lopez, Fuentes, Burnett, Ervin, Rodriguez-Sanchez, Ramirez-Rosa, Mitts, Sposato, Vasquez, Knudsen, Clay, Martin, Manaa-Hoppenworth, Hadden -- 27.

Nays -- Alderpersons Hopkins, Beale, Chico, Lee, Quinn, Lopez, Moore, Curtis, O'Shea, Tabares, Scott, Taliaferro, Cruz, Cardona, Waguespack, Conway, Villegas, Nugent, Napolitano, Reilly, Lawson, Gardiner, Silverstein -- 23.

After debate on the matter, Alderperson Beale and Alderperson Lopez requested that the ordinance be Deferred and ordered published.
The following is said proposed ordinance transmitted with the foregoing committee report:

WHEREAS, The City of Chicago (the "City") is a duly constituted and existing municipality within the meaning of Section 1 of Article VII of the 1970 Constitution (the "Constitution") of the State of Illinois (the "State") having a population in excess of 25,000 and is a home rule unit of local government under Section 6(a) of Article VII of the Constitution; and

Be It Ordained by the City Council of the City of Chicago:

Article I.

Authorization And Debt Issuance.

SECTION 1.1 Authorization. The City Council, after a public meeting heretofore held on this Ordinance by the Committee on Finance of the City Council (the "Finance Committee"), pursuant to proper notice and in accordance with the findings and recommendations of the Finance Committee, hereby finds that all of the recitals contained in the preambles to this Ordinance are full, true and correct and does incorporate them into this Ordinance by this reference. This Ordinance is adopted pursuant to Section 6(a) of Article VII of the Constitution. The City has determined that it is in the best interests of the inhabitants of the City and necessary for the welfare of the government and affairs of the City to implement the Financing Plan. The City has heretofore authorized, or may authorize in the future, the borrowing of money pursuant to one or more line of credit agreements to provide funds for interim financing for capital projects, including, but not limited to the Purposes, with such borrowing incurred by the City with the intention of being repaid by Bond proceeds (such borrowings being referred to as "Line of Credit Indebtedness"). Proceeds of any Line of Credit Indebtedness shall be referred to as "Line of Credit Proceeds".

Article II.

Authorization And Details Of General Obligation Bonds.

SECTION 2.1 Findings And Determinations. The City Council hereby finds and determines as follows:

(a) that the issuance of the Bonds to implement the Financing Plan is in the best interests of the City;

(b) that the City's ability to issue the Bonds from time to time without further action by the City Council at various times, in various principal amounts and with various interest rates and interest rate mechanisms, maturities, redemption provisions and other terms will enhance the City's opportunities to obtain financing upon the most favorable terms available; and

(c) that authority is granted to the Mayor or an Authorized Officer to determine to sell one or more series of the Bonds, at one or more times, as and to the extent the Mayor or an Authorized Officer determines that such sale or sales is desirable and in the best interests of the City.
SECTION 2.2 Authorization Of Bonds And Trust Indentures.

(a) Bonds are hereby authorized to be issued in one or more series in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $830,000,000 (the "Debt Issuance Limitation") for the purpose of implementing the Financing Plan which consists of: (A) financing all or a portion of the cost of the Purposes including therewith: (i) costs of issuance, including any underwriters' discount, origination fee or similar fee charged by any Purchasers (as hereinafter defined); (ii) capitalized interest on the Bonds; and (iii) credit enhancements (including, but not limited to, premiums for the purchase of policies of municipal bond insurance with respect to the Bonds); and (B) refinancing Line of Credit Indebtedness relating to interim financing for the Purposes.

(b) The Bonds may be issued from time to time in one or more series in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding the Debt Issuance Limitation, or such lesser amounts as may be determined by an Authorized Officer.

(c) The Bonds of each series may be issued pursuant to, and have such terms and provisions as are set forth in, a Trust Indenture between the City and a Bond Trustee substantially in the form attached as Exhibit A, which is incorporated in this Ordinance by this reference, but with such revisions in text as the Mayor or the Authorized Officer executing the same shall determine are necessary or desirable, the execution thereof, and any amendment thereto, by the Mayor or such Authorized Officer to evidence the City Council's approval of all such revisions. Such revisions may include, among other things: (i) revisions required in the case of the issuance of a series of Taxable Bonds; (ii) revisions required to accommodate the sale of the Bonds on a forward-delivery basis; (iii) revisions required to accommodate the sale of the Bonds to a Direct Purchaser (as hereinafter defined); and (iv) revisions required to reflect the issuance of the Bonds as Direct Purchase Bonds (as hereinafter defined). With respect to any series of Bonds issued pursuant to a Trust Indenture, in the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Ordinance and such Trust Indenture (including in the form of Bond attached thereto as an exhibit), the terms of such Trust Indenture shall be deemed to control. The Mayor or an Authorized Officer is authorized to enter into one or more of such Trust Indentures from time to time on behalf of the City.

(d) The Bonds will bear interest at fixed rates and pay interest as described below. Each series of Bonds shall be dated such date as shall be agreed upon by an Authorized Officer and the purchasers of such Bonds, shall be in fully registered form, shall be in such minimum denominations and integral multiples thereof as shall be agreed upon by an Authorized Officer and the purchasers of such Bonds (but no single Bond shall represent installments of principal maturing on more than one date), and shall be numbered as determined by the applicable Bond Registrar (as hereinafter defined).

All or any portion of the Bonds may be issued and sold from time to time as a direct purchase (the "Direct Purchase Bonds") to a purchaser or purchasers other than the Underwriters (as hereinafter defined) (individually, a "Direct Purchaser" and collectively, the "Direct Purchasers"). The Direct Purchase Bonds shall be sold as provided in Section 2.18 hereof.
(e) Any series of the Bonds may be issued on a forward-delivery basis.

(f) The principal of the Bonds of each series shall become due and payable on or before 40 years after the date of issuance of such series. Each series of Bonds shall bear interest at a rate or rates not to exceed 12 percent per annum. Any portion of the Bonds may be issued as Taxable Bonds or Tax-Exempt Bonds as determined by an Authorized Officer to be beneficial to the City.

(g) Each Bond shall bear interest from the later of its date or the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, until the principal amount of such Bond is paid, such interest (computed upon the basis of a 360-day period of twelve 30-day months) being payable on the dates as shall be determined by an Authorized Officer at the time of the sale of each series of Bonds. Interest on each Bond shall be paid to the person in whose name such Bond is registered at the close of business on the 15th day of the month next preceding the interest payment date, by check or draft of the applicable Bond Registrar, or, at the option of any registered owner of $1,000,000 or more in aggregate principal amount of Bonds of a series, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank in the continental United States of America as the registered owner of such Bonds shall request in writing to the applicable Bond Registrar.

The principal of the Bonds and any redemption premium shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of America upon presentation and surrender thereof at the designated corporate trust office of the applicable Bond Registrar.

(h) Each of the Bonds shall be designated "General Obligation Bonds, Series __" or shall have such other designations or descriptions as determined by an Authorized Officer to be necessary to properly identify and differentiate the Bonds at the time of the sale of the Bonds, and with such other additions, modifications or revisions as shall be determined to be necessary by an Authorized Officer at the time of the sale of such Bonds to reflect the calendar year of issuance of the Bonds, the order of sale of the Bonds, the specific series of the Bonds, whether the Bonds are being issued as Taxable Bonds or Tax-Exempt Bonds, whether the Bonds are Direct Purchase Bonds, the purposes for which the Bonds are being sold and any other authorized features of the Bonds determined by an Authorized Officer as desirable to be reflected in the title of the Bonds being issued and sold.

SECTION 2.3 Execution And Authentication.

(a) The seal of the City or a facsimile thereof shall be affixed to or printed on each of the Bonds, and the Bonds shall be executed by the manual or facsimile signature of the duly qualified and acting Mayor and attested by the manual or facsimile signature of the duly qualified and acting City Clerk of the City (the "City Clerk"), and in case any officer whose signature shall appear on any Bond shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such Bond, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if such officer had remained in office until delivery.
(b) All Bonds shall have thereon a certificate of authentication substantially in the form hereinafter set forth duly executed by the applicable Bond Registrar or Bond Trustee as authenticating agent of the City and showing the date of authentication. No Bond shall be valid or obligatory for any purpose or be entitled to any security or benefit under this Ordinance unless and until such certificate of authentication shall have been duly executed by the applicable Bond Registrar or Bond Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate of authentication upon any such Bond shall be conclusive evidence that such Bond has been authenticated and delivered under this Ordinance. The certificate of authentication on any Bond shall be deemed to have been executed by the applicable Bond Registrar or Bond Trustee if signed by an authorized officer of such Bond Registrar or Bond Trustee, but it shall not be necessary that the same officer sign the certificate of authentication on all of the Bonds issued under this Ordinance.

SECTION 2.4 Registration And Transfer.

(a) The City shall cause books (the "Bond Register") for the registration and for the transfer of each series of Bonds as provided in this Ordinance to be kept at the designated corporate trust office of a bank or trust company designated by an Authorized Officer, as the registrar for the City in connection with such series of Bonds (the "Bond Registrar"), which shall, with respect to a series of Bonds issued pursuant to a Trust Indenture, be the Bond Trustee for such series of Bonds. The City is authorized to prepare multiple Bond blanks executed by the Mayor and attested by the City Clerk for use in the transfer and exchange of Bonds.

(b) Upon surrender for transfer of any Bond at the designated corporate trust office of the applicable Bond Registrar, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to such Bond Registrar and duly executed by the registered owner or its attorney duly authorized in writing, the City shall execute and such Bond Registrar shall authenticate, date and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees one or more fully registered Bonds of the same series, interest rate and maturity of authorized denominations, for a like principal amount. Any Bond or Bonds may be exchanged at said office of the applicable Bond Registrar for a like aggregate principal amount of Bonds of the same series, type, interest rate and maturity of other authorized denominations. The execution by the City of any fully registered Bond shall constitute full and due authorization of such Bond, and the applicable Bond Registrar shall thereby be authorized to authenticate, date and deliver such Bond; provided that the aggregate principal amount of Bonds of each series, maturity and interest rate authenticated by the applicable Bond Registrar or Bond Trustee shall not exceed the authorized principal amount of Bonds for such series, maturity and interest rate less previous retirements.

(c) The applicable Bond Registrar shall not be required to transfer or exchange: (i) any Bond after notice calling such Bond for redemption has been mailed; or (ii) any Bond during a period of 15 days next preceding mailing of a notice of redemption of such Bond; provided, however, that provisions relating to the transfer or exchange of Bonds of a series shall be as determined by an Authorized Officer at the time of the sale of such series and may be set forth in a notification of sale as described in Section 2.18(i) hereof (a "Notification of Sale").
(d) The person in whose name any Bond is registered shall be deemed and regarded as the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and payment of the principal of, redemption premium, if any, or interest on any Bond, as appropriate, shall be made only to or upon the order of the registered owner thereof or its legal representative. All such payments shall be valid and effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability upon such Bond to the extent of the sum or sums so paid.

(e) No service charge shall be made for any transfer or exchange of Bonds, but the City or the applicable Bond Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Bonds, except that no such payment may be required in the case of the issuance of a Bond or Bonds for the unredeemed portion of the Bond surrendered for redemption.

SECTION 2.5 Book-Entry Only System. If so determined and directed by an Authorized Officer in connection with the sale of any of the Bonds, such Bonds may be issued in book entry only form. In connection with the issuance of Bonds in book entry only form, an Authorized Officer is authorized to execute and deliver to the book entry depository selected by such Authorized Officer such depository’s standard form of representation letter. If any of the Bonds are registered in the name of a securities depository which uses a book entry system, the standing of the beneficial owner to enforce any of the covenants herein may be established through the books and records of such securities depository or a participant therein.

SECTION 2.6 Replacement Of Bonds. If any Bond, whether in temporary or definitive form, is lost (whether by reason of theft or otherwise), destroyed (whether by mutilation, damage, in whole or in part, or otherwise) or improperly cancelled, the applicable Bond Registrar may authenticate a new Bond of like series, date, maturity date, interest rate, denomination and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding; provided that: (i) in the case of any mutilated Bond, such mutilated Bond shall first be surrendered to the applicable Bond Registrar; and (ii) in the case of any lost Bond or Bond destroyed in whole, there shall be first furnished to the applicable Bond Registrar evidence of such loss or destruction, together with indemnification of the City and such Bond Registrar, satisfactory to such Bond Registrar. If any lost, destroyed or improperly cancelled Bond shall have matured or is about to mature, or has been called for redemption, instead of issuing a duplicate Bond, the applicable Bond Registrar shall pay the same without surrender thereof if there shall be first furnished to such Bond Registrar evidence of such loss, destruction or cancellation, together with indemnity, satisfactory to it. Upon the issuance of any substitute Bond, the applicable Bond Registrar may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto.
SECTION 2.7 Redemption And Repurchase.

(a) The Bonds may be made subject to redemption prior to maturity at the option of the City, in whole or in part on any date, at such times and at such redemption prices (to be expressed as a percentage of the principal amount of Bonds being redeemed to be redeemed) not to exceed 120 percent, plus, accrued interest to the date of redemption, as determined by an Authorized Officer at the time of the sale thereof.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, such 120 percent limitation on the redemption price of Bonds shall not apply where the redemption price is based upon a formula designed to compensate the owner of the Bonds to be redeemed based upon prevailing market conditions on the date fixed for redemption, commonly known as a "make-whole" redemption price (the "Make-Whole Redemption Price"). At the time of sale of the Bonds, an Authorized Officer shall determine the provisions of the formula to be used to establish any Make-Whole Redemption Price, which may vary depending on whether the Bonds are issued as Taxable Bonds or Tax Exempt Bonds. An Authorized Officer shall confirm and transmit the applicable Make-Whole Redemption Price on such dates and to such parties as shall be necessary to effectuate such redemption.

(c) If fewer than all of the outstanding Bonds of a series are to be optionally redeemed, the Bonds to be called shall be called from such maturities and interest rates of such series as may be determined by an Authorized Officer.

(d) Certain of the Bonds of a series may be made subject to mandatory redemption, at par and accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption, as determined by an Authorized Officer at the time of the sale thereof.

(e) An Authorized Officer is authorized to sell (at a price determined by such Authorized Officer to be in the best interests of the City) or waive any right the City may have to call any of the Bonds for optional redemption, in whole or in part, and is further authorized to expend the proceeds of any such sales for any purpose for which the proceeds of the Bonds are authorized to be expended and for the payment or prepayment of any City debt obligations whether issued before or after the date of adoption of this Ordinance, all as determined by an Authorized Officer; provided however, to the extent that interest on such Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, such expenditures shall not adversely affect such exclusion. If determined to be necessary or appropriate, an Authorized Officer is authorized to solicit the consent of holders of outstanding Bonds to any such sale or waiver.

(f) At the time of sale of Bonds of a series, an Authorized Officer is authorized to determine the manner of redeeming such Bonds, either by lot in the manner hereinafter provided or pro rata in the manner determined by an Authorized Officer at the time of sale, if less than all of the Bonds of the same series, maturity and interest rate are to be redeemed.
(g) The Bonds shall be redeemed only in amounts equal to the respective minimum authorized denominations and integral multiples thereof. In the event of the redemption of fewer than all the Bonds of the same series, maturity and interest rate by lot, the aggregate principal amount thereof to be redeemed shall be the minimum authorized denomination for such series or an integral multiple thereof, and the applicable Bond Registrar shall assign to each Bond of such series, maturity and interest rate, a distinctive number for each minimum authorized denomination of such Bond and shall select by lot from the numbers so assigned as many numbers as, at such minimum authorized denomination for each number, shall equal the principal amount of such Bonds to be redeemed. In such case, the Bonds to be redeemed shall be those to which were assigned numbers so selected; provided that only so much of the principal amount of each Bond shall be redeemed as shall equal such minimum authorized denomination for each number assigned to it and so selected. In the event of the redemption of fewer than all Bonds of the same series, maturity and interest rate on a pro rata basis, if the Bonds are held in book entry form at the time of redemption, at the time of sale of the Bonds, an Authorized Officer is authorized to direct the Bond Registrar to instruct the book entry depository to select the specific Bonds within such maturity and interest rate for redemption pro rata among such Bonds. The City shall have no responsibility or obligation to ensure that the book entry depository properly selects such Bonds for redemption.

(h) An Authorized Officer shall, at least 45 days prior to any optional redemption date (unless a shorter time period shall be satisfactory to the applicable Bond Registrar), notify the applicable Bond Registrar of such redemption date and of the principal amount of Bonds of such series to be redeemed.

(i) In connection with any mandatory redemption of Bonds of a series as authorized above, the principal amounts of Bonds of such series to be mandatorily redeemed in each year may be reduced through the earlier optional redemption thereof, with any partial optional redemptions of such Bonds of such series credited against future mandatory redemption requirements in such order of the mandatory redemption dates as an Authorized Officer may determine. In addition, on or prior to the 60th day preceding any mandatory redemption date of Bonds of a series, the applicable Bond Registrar may, and if directed by an Authorized Officer shall, purchase Bonds of such series required to be retired on such mandatory redemption date at such prices as an Authorized Officer shall determine. Any such Bonds so purchased shall be cancelled and the principal amount thereof shall be credited against the payment required on such next mandatory redemption date with respect to such series of Bonds.

(j) The applicable Bond Registrar shall promptly notify the City in writing of the Bonds, or portions thereof, selected for redemption and, in the case of any Bond selected for partial redemption, the principal amount and the interest rate thereof to be redeemed.

(k) Subject to the limitation on redemption price set forth above, the terms of such redemption shall be determined by an Authorized Officer at the time of sale of the Bonds of each series and may be set forth in a Notification of Sale.
SECTION 2.8 Notice Of Redemption.

(a) Unless waived by any owner of Bonds to be redeemed, notice of the call for any such redemption shall be given by the applicable Bond Registrar on behalf of the City by mailing the redemption notice by first class mail at least 20 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to the registered owner of the Bond or Bonds to be redeemed at the address shown on the applicable Bond Register or at such other address as is furnished in writing by such registered owner to such Bond Registrar, but the failure to mail any such notice or any defect therein as to any Bond shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Bond. Any notice of redemption mailed as provided in this Section shall be conclusively presumed to have been given whether or not actually received by the addressee.

(b) All notices of redemption shall state:

(1) the series designation of the Bonds to be redeemed,

(2) the redemption date,

(3) the redemption price, or in the case of a redemption of Bonds at a Make-Whole Redemption Price, a description of the formula by which the redemption price shall be determined,

(4) if less than all outstanding Bonds of a series are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the respective principal amounts and interest rates) of the Bonds to be redeemed,

(5) that on the redemption date the redemption price will become due and payable upon each such Bond or portion thereof called for redemption, and that interest thereon shall cease to accrue from and after said date,

(6) the place where such Bonds are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price, which place of payment shall be the designated corporate trust office of the applicable Bond Registrar, and

(7) such other information as shall be deemed necessary by the applicable Bond Registrar at the time such notice is given to comply with law, regulation or industry standard.

(c) With respect to an optional redemption of any series of Bonds, such notice may state that said redemption is conditioned upon the receipt by the applicable Bond Registrar on or prior to the date fixed for redemption of moneys sufficient to pay the redemption price of the Bonds of such series. If such moneys are not so received, such redemption notice shall be
of no force and effect, the City shall not redeem such Bonds and the applicable Bond Registrar shall give notice, in the same manner in which the notice of redemption was given, that such moneys were not so received and that such Bonds will not be redeemed. Unless the notice of redemption shall be made conditional as provided above, on or prior to any redemption date for a series of Bonds, the City shall deposit with the applicable Bond Registrar an amount of money sufficient to pay the redemption price of all the Bonds or portions thereof of such series which are to be redeemed on that date.

(d) Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Bonds, or portions thereof, so to be redeemed shall, on the redemption date, become due and payable at the redemption price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the City defaults in the payment of the redemption price or unless, in the event of a conditional notice as described above, the necessary moneys were not deposited) such Bonds, or portions thereof, shall cease to bear or accrue interest. Upon surrender of such Bonds for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Bonds shall be paid by the applicable Bond Registrar at the redemption price. Installments of interest due on or prior to the redemption date shall be payable as herein provided for payment of interest. Upon surrender for any partial redemption of any Bond, there shall be prepared for the registered owner a new Bond or Bonds of the same series, interest rate and maturity in the amount of the unpaid principal.

(e) If any Bond or portion thereof called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest from the redemption date at the rate borne by such Bond, or portion thereof, so called for redemption. All Bonds which have been redeemed shall be cancelled and destroyed by the applicable Bond Registrar and shall not be reissued.

(f) If any Bond is not presented for payment when the principal amount thereof becomes due, either at maturity or at a date fixed for redemption thereof or otherwise, and if moneys sufficient to pay such Bond are held by the applicable Bond Registrar for the benefit of the registered owner of such Bond, such Bond Registrar shall hold such moneys for the benefit of the registered owner of such Bond without liability to the registered owner for interest. The registered owner of such Bond thereafter shall be restricted exclusively to such funds for satisfaction of any claims relating to such Bond.

SECTION 2.9 Form Of Bonds. The Bonds of each series shall be prepared in substantially the following form with such insertions and revisions as shall be necessary to reflect the terms and provisions of the sale of the Bonds of such series pursuant to Section 2.18 hereof; provided that if the text of any Bond is to be printed in its entirety on the front side of such Bond, then the text shown or appearing on the reverse side of such Bond shall replace the second paragraph on the front side of the form of the Bond shown below and the legend, “See Reverse Side for Additional Provisions”, shall be omitted.

SECTION 2.10 General Obligations. Each Bond shall be a direct and general
obligation of the City for the payment of which (as to principal, interest and
redemption premium, if any, as appropriate) the City pledges its full faith and credit. Each
Bond shall be payable (as to principal, interest and redemption premium, if any, as
appropriate) from any moneys, revenues, receipts, income, assets or funds of the
City legally available for such purpose, including but not limited to the proceeds of the
Pledged Taxes (as defined in Section 2.11 hereof), except as provided in Section 2.11
hereof. Repayment of one or more series of Bonds may be secured by repayments of
loans funded by such Bonds, if determined by an Authorized Officer at the time of issuance
of such Bonds to be in the best interests of the City. Each Authorized Officer is authorized
to make such determinations.

SECTION 2.11 Tax Levy.

(a) For the purpose of providing the funds required to pay as the same become due:
(i) the principal of and interest and redemption premium, if any, on the Bonds; and (ii) to the
extent determined by an Authorized Officer to be necessary or desirable, periodic fees and
expenses payable to parties involved in the provision of ongoing services relating to the
Bonds, such as rating agencies and entities providing financial market information to be
used in connection with the structuring and sale of the Bonds (the "Ongoing Financing
Services"), there is hereby levied upon all of the taxable property within the City, in the years
for which any of said Bonds are outstanding, a direct annual tax sufficient for that purpose,
provided, however, that such levy shall not exceed $160,000,000 in any single levy year.
Such levy for a series of the Bonds shall be fully set forth in one or more Notifications of
Sale delivered in connection with the sale of such series of the Bonds; provided that
collections of such levy for any year in an amount in excess of that necessary to make the
payments described in clauses (i) and (ii), above (x) may be used for any lawful public
purpose designated by the City Council or (y) may be reduced and abated by an Authorized
Officer if such reduction is deemed desirable by an Authorized Officer in connection with the
sale or sales of the Bonds, in each case as determined from time to time by an Authorized
Officer as provided in Section 2.18 hereof.
(b) The tax levy made in this Section is not subject to the "Aggregate Levy" limitation contained in the Chicago Property Tax Limitation Ordinance contained in Chapter 3-92 of the Municipal Code of Chicago (the "Municipal Code"), and Section 3-92-020 of the Municipal Code is superseded to exclude the tax levy herein from the definition of "Aggregate Levy" contained therein.

(c) The term "Pledged Taxes" means the taxes hereinabove levied for collection for the purpose of providing the funds necessary to make the payments described in clauses (a)(i) and (ii) of this section, and also includes any amounts deposited into the hereinafter defined Bond Fund or deposited with the Ad Valorem Tax Escrow Agent (as defined in Section 2.13 hereof) by an Authorized Officer for the purpose of paying principal of and interest on the Bonds and any accrued interest received and deposited in the Bond Fund or the Ad Valorem Tax Escrow Account, if established pursuant to Section 2.13 hereof.

The City reserves the right to abate all or a portion of the Pledged Taxes required to be levied in any year if and to the extent on or before March 31 of the next succeeding calendar year (or such earlier date as may be required by law), the City has on hand amounts dedicated to the payments described in clause (i) of paragraph (a) of this section due during the one year period commencing on January 2 of such succeeding calendar year. The City may, but shall not be required to, cause the levy or extension in any year of taxes for the payment of the costs of Ongoing Financing Services.

SECTION 2.12 Continuing Appropriation. The City shall appropriate or otherwise provide amounts sufficient to pay principal of and interest on the Bonds for the years such amounts are due, and the City covenants to take timely action as required by law to carry out the provisions of this Section, but, if for any such year it fails to do so, this Ordinance shall constitute a continuing appropriation of such amounts without any further action on the part of the City Council.

SECTION 2.13 Bond Funds. Each Authorized Officer is authorized to establish one or more special accounts, if determined to be necessary in connection with the sale of any of the Bonds, separate and segregated from all other funds and accounts of the City (each a "Bond Fund"), which shall be: (i) held by an Authorized Officer; or (ii) maintained by a Bond Trustee pursuant to a Trust Indenture; or (iii) maintained with a bank or trust company to be designated by an Authorized Officer (each an "Ad Valorem Tax Escrow Account") pursuant to an escrow agreement (each an "Ad Valorem Tax Escrow Agreement"), between the City and the applicable Escrow Agent named therein (each an "Ad Valorem Tax Escrow Agent"), and each Authorized Officer is authorized to execute and deliver one or more Ad Valorem Tax Escrow Agreements in connection with the sale of the Bonds in such form as the officers so executing such agreement may deem appropriate in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance.

SECTION 2.14 Direct Deposit Of Pledged Taxes. In lieu of the proceeds of the Pledged Taxes being deposited with the City Treasurer of the City (the "City Treasurer"), each Authorized Officer is authorized to direct the County Collectors (the "County Collectors") of
The County of Cook, Illinois ("Cook County") and The County of DuPage, Illinois ("DuPage County") to deposit the proceeds of the Pledged Taxes directly into the Bond Fund held pursuant to the applicable Trust Indenture or the applicable Ad Valorem Tax Escrow Account, if such Trust Indenture has been executed and delivered or such Ad Valorem Tax Escrow Account has been created.

SECTION 2.15 Legally Available Funds. If the Pledged Taxes to be applied to the payment of the Bonds are not available in time to make any payments of principal of or interest on the Bonds when due, then an Authorized Officer is directed to make such payments from any other moneys, revenues, receipts, income, assets or funds of the City that are legally available for that purpose in advance of the collection of such Pledged Taxes, and when the proceeds thereof are received, such other funds shall be replenished, all to the end that the credit of the City may be preserved by the prompt payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds as the same become due.

SECTION 2.16 Filing Of Ordinance And Notification Of Sale With County Clerks. A copy of this Ordinance, duly certified by the City Clerk, and a copy of each Notification of Sale shall be filed in the respective offices of the County Clerks of Cook County and DuPage County (the "County Clerks"), and such filing of each Notification of Sale shall constitute the authority for, and it shall be the duty of, the County Clerks to extend the taxes levied pursuant to Section 2.11 hereof for collection in such years as shall be indicated in each such Notification of Sale, such taxes to be in addition to and in excess of all other taxes heretofore or hereafter authorized to be levied by the City on its behalf.

SECTION 2.17 Additional Filings Of Ordinance. A copy of this Ordinance, duly certified by the City Clerk, shall also be filed with each applicable Bond Trustee, each applicable Ad Valorem Tax Escrow Agent, if any, each applicable Bond Registrar, and if the County Collectors are authorized to deposit the proceeds of the Pledged Taxes levied pursuant to Section 2.11 hereof directly with a Bond Trustee or an Ad Valorem Tax Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 2.14 hereof, with such County Collectors.

SECTION 2.18 Bond Sales.

(a) Each Authorized Officer is authorized to sell all or any portion of the Bonds from time to time: (i) to or at the direction of an underwriter or group of underwriters to be selected by such Authorized Officer (the "Underwriters"); or (ii) to or at the direction of a Direct Purchaser (the Underwriters and Direct Purchasers being collectively referred to herein as the "Purchasers"), on such terms as such Authorized Officer may deem to be in the best interests of the City within the limitations set forth in this Ordinance, with the concurrence of the Chairman of the Finance Committee.

The Bonds may be sold from time to time as an Authorized Officer shall determine that the proceeds of such sales are needed.

SECTION 2.23 Defeasance And Provision For Payment.

(a) If payment or provision for payment is made, to or for the registered owners of all or a portion of the Bonds, and the principal of and interest due and to become due on any Bond at the times and in the manner stipulated therein, and there is paid or caused to be paid to the applicable Bond Registrar or Bond Trustee, the applicable Ad Valorem Tax Escrow Agent as provided in Section 2.13 hereof, or such bank or trust company as shall be designated by an Authorized Officer (such bank or trust company hereinafter referred to as a "Defeasance Escrow Agent"), all sums of money due and to become due according to the provisions of this Ordinance, then these presents and the estate and rights granted by this Ordinance shall cease, terminate and be void as to those Bonds or portions thereof except for purposes of registration, transfer and exchange of Bonds and any such payment from such moneys or obligations. Any Bond shall be deemed to be paid within the meaning of this section when payment of the principal of any such Bond, plus interest thereon to the due date thereof (whether such due date be by reason of maturity or upon redemption as provided in this Ordinance or otherwise), either: (a) shall have been made or caused to have been made in accordance with the terms thereof; or (b) shall have been provided for by irrevocably depositing with the applicable Bond Registrar or Bond Trustee, the applicable Ad Valorem Tax Escrow Agent as provided in Section 2.13 hereof, or a Defeasance Escrow Agent, in trust and exclusively for such payment: (1) moneys sufficient to make such payment; or (2)(A) direct obligations of the United States of America; (B) obligations of agencies of the United States of America, the timely payment of principal of and interest on which are guaranteed by the United States of America; (C) obligations of the following agencies: Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) debt obligations, Farm Credit System (formerly: Federal Land Banks, Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, and Banks for Cooperatives) debt obligations, Federal Home Loan Banks (FHL Banks) debt obligations, Fannie Mae debt obligations, and Resolution Funding Corporation (REFCORP) debt obligations; (D) pre-refunded municipal obligations defined as follows: any bonds or other obligations of any state of the United States of America or of any agency,

At such times as a Bond shall be deemed to be paid hereunder, as aforesaid, it shall no longer be secured by or entitled to the benefits of this Ordinance, except for the purposes of registration, transfer and exchange of Bonds and any such payment from such moneys or obligations. The defeasance of Bonds under this Ordinance shall also be subject to any additional terms and conditions in the applicable Trust Indenture, if any.

(b) No such deposit under this Section shall be made or accepted hereunder and no use made of any such deposit unless, in the case of Tax Exempt Bonds, the applicable Bond Registrar or Bond Trustee, the applicable Ad Valorem Tax Escrow Agent, or the applicable Defeasance Escrow Agent, as the case may be, shall have received an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel to the effect that such deposit and use would not cause any of such Tax Exempt Bonds to be treated as "arbitrage bonds" within the meaning of Section 148 of the Code or any successor provision thereto.

(c) Nothing in this Ordinance shall prohibit a defeasance deposit of escrow securities as provided in this Section from being subject to a subsequent sale of such escrow securities and reinvestment of all or a portion of the proceeds of that sale in escrow securities which, together with money to remain so held in trust, shall be sufficient to provide for payment of principal, redemption premium, if any, and interest on any of the defeased Bonds, as appropriate. Amounts held by the applicable Bond Registrar or Bond Trustee, the applicable Ad Valorem Tax Escrow Agent, or any Defeasance Escrow Agent, in excess of the amounts needed so to provide for payment of the defeased Bonds, may be subject to withdrawal by the City. The Mayor or an Authorized Officer is authorized to execute and deliver from time to time one or more agreements (and amendments thereto) with counterparties selected by an Authorized Officer, with respect to the investment and use of such excess amounts held by the applicable Bond Registrar or Bond Trustee, the applicable Ad Valorem Tax Escrow Agent, or a Defeasance Escrow Agent.

SECTION 2.24 Appropriation Of Funds. Notwithstanding any ordinance to the contrary, funds in the City's Corporate Fund may be used for the purpose of paying the costs of the Purposes. The City shall reimburse the Corporate Fund for any moneys in the Corporate Fund so used to pay the costs of the Purposes from the proceeds of the Bonds upon the issuance thereof. Funds in the Corporate Fund expended pursuant to authority granted in this Section and intended to be reimbursed from Bond proceeds shall be referred to as "Corporate Funds".

The City shall have no obligation to make any investigation to determine the occurrence of any events that would permit the City to make any determination described in this paragraph.

at the address shown on the Bond Register or at such other address as is furnished in writing by such Registered Owner to the Trustee, but the failure to mail any such notice or any defect therein as to any Bond shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Bond.

All notices of redemption shall state:

(1) the Series designation of the Bonds to be redeemed,

(b) With respect to an optional redemption of Bonds, such notice may state that said redemption is conditioned upon the receipt by the Trustee on or prior to the date fixed for redemption of moneys sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of the Bonds. If such moneys are not so received, such redemption notice shall be of no force and effect, the City shall not redeem such Bonds and such failure to deposit such funds shall not constitute an Event of Default under this Indenture. The Trustee shall give notice, in the same manner in which the notice of redemption was given, that such moneys were not so received and that such Bonds will not be redeemed. Unless the notice of redemption shall be made conditional as provided above, on or prior to any redemption date for the Bonds, the City shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all the Bonds or portions thereof which are to be redeemed on that date.

(c) Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Bonds, or portions thereof, so to be redeemed shall, on the redemption date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the City defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price or unless, in the event of a conditional notice as described above, the necessary moneys were not deposited) such Bonds, or portions thereof, shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of such Bonds for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Bonds shall be paid
by the Trustee at the Redemption Price. Installments of interest due on or prior to the redemption date shall be payable as herein provided for payment of interest.

(d) If any Bond, or portion thereof, called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest from the redemption date at the rate borne by such Bond, or portion thereof, so called for redemption. All Bonds which have been redeemed shall be cancelled and destroyed by the Trustee and shall not be reissued.

(e) Failure to give notice in the manner prescribed hereunder with respect to any Bond, or any defect in such notice, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for redemption for any Bond with respect to which notice was properly given. Upon the happening of the above conditions and if sufficient moneys are on deposit with the Trustee on the applicable redemption date to redeem the Bonds to be redeemed and to pay interest due thereon and premium, if any, the Bonds thus called shall not, after the applicable redemption date, bear interest, be protected by this Indenture or the Bond Ordinance or be deemed to be Outstanding under the provisions of this Indenture.

(f) If any Bond is transferred or exchanged on the Bond Register after notice has been given calling such Bond for redemption, the Trustee will attach a copy of such notice to the Bond issued in connection with such transfer or exchange.

(g) If any Bond is not presented for payment when the principal amount thereof becomes due, either at maturity or at a date fixed for redemption thereof or otherwise, and if moneys sufficient to pay such Bond are held by the Trustee for the benefit of the Registered Owner of such Bond, the Trustee shall hold such moneys for the benefit of the Registered Owner of such Bond without liability to the Registered Owner for interest. The Registered Owner of such Bond thereafter shall be restricted exclusively to such funds for satisfaction of any claims relating to such Bond.

If less than all the Bonds shall be called for redemption under any provision of this Indenture permitting such partial redemption, (i) such redemption shall be by lot in such manner as the Trustee may determine among such Bonds, and (ii) subject to other applicable provisions of this Indenture, the portion of any Bond to be redeemed shall be in a principal amount equal to an Authorized Denomination. In selecting Bonds for redemption, the Trustee shall assign to each Bond of like Maturity Date and interest rate, a distinctive number for each minimum Authorized Denomination of such Bond and shall select by lot from the numbers so assigned as many numbers as, at such minimum Authorized Denomination for each number, shall equal the principal amount of such Bonds to be redeemed. In such case, the Bonds to be redeemed shall be those to which were assigned numbers so selected; provided that only so much of the principal amount of each Bond shall be redeemed as shall equal such minimum Authorized Denomination for each number assigned to it and so selected. If it is determined that one or more, but not all, of the integral multiples of the Authorized Denomination of principal amount represented by any Bond is to be called for redemption, then, upon notice of intention to redeem such integral multiple of an Authorized Denomination, the Registered Owner
of such Bond shall forthwith surrender such Bond to the Trustee for (a) payment to such Registered Owner of the Redemption Price of the integral multiple of the Authorized Denomination of principal amount called for redemption, and (b) delivery to such Registered Owner of a new Bond or Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of the unredeemed balance of the principal amount of such Bond. New Bonds representing the unredeemed balance of the principal amount of such Bond shall be issued to the Registered Owner thereof without charge therefor.

The Trustee shall promptly notify the City in writing of the Bonds, or portions thereof, selected for redemption and, in the case of any Bond selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof, and the interest rate thereof to be redeemed.

Section 3.04. Deposit of Funds.

Moneys on deposit in the Series ____ Costs of Issuance Account, including the investment earnings thereon, remaining after all disbursements for payment of the costs of issuance have been made shall be deposited by the Trustee to the Series ____ Investment Earnings Account.

(d) Moneys in the Project Fund shall be invested at the written direction of an Authorized Officer to the fullest extent practicable in Permitted Investments maturing in such amounts and at such times as may be necessary to provide funds when needed to pay, as applicable, Project Costs or costs of issuance of the Bonds or such other costs as may be required to be paid from such moneys. The City may, and to the extent required for payments from the Project Fund shall, direct the Trustee in writing to sell any such Permitted Investments at any time, and the proceeds of such sale, and of all payments at maturity and upon redemption of such investments, shall be held in the Project Fund. Investment earnings received on moneys or securities in the Project Fund shall be deposited to the Series ____ Investment Earnings Account.

(e) The completion, substantial completion or abandonment of each capital project set forth in Section 4.03(b)(i)-(xiii) and comprising the Project shall be evidenced by a certificate of an Authorized Officer, which shall be filed promptly with the Trustee, stating the date of such completion, anticipated completion or abandonment and the amount, if any, required in the opinion of the signer of such certificate for the payment of any remaining part of the Project Costs. Upon the filing of such certificate, the balance in the Project Fund in excess of the amount, if any, stated in such certificate of the City as necessary to complete the Project shall be deposited into the Principal and Interest Account and applied as directed in such certificate; provided that such direction shall be consistent with Section 4.07 and applicable provisions of the Tax Certificate.

In addition to the Principal and Interest Account Requirement, there shall be deposited into the Bond Fund any other moneys received by the Trustee under and pursuant to this Indenture, when accompanied by directions from the person depositing such moneys that such moneys are to be paid into the Bond Fund and to one or more accounts therein.

Upon calculation by the Trustee of each Principal and Interest Account Requirement under this Section, the Trustee shall notify the City of the Principal and Interest Account Requirement and the Deposit Date to which it relates, and shall provide the City with such supporting documentation and calculations as the City may reasonably request.

Section 4.06. Tax Covenants. (a) The City covenants that it will take no action in the investment of the proceeds of the Bonds which would result in making the interest payable on any of such Bonds subject to federal income taxes by reason of such Bonds being classified as "arbitrage bonds" within the meaning of Section 148 of the Code.

(b) The City further covenants that it will act with respect to the proceeds of the Bonds, the earnings on the proceeds of such Bonds and any other moneys on deposit in any fund or account maintained in respect of such Bonds, including, if necessary, a rebate of such earnings to the United States of America, in a manner which would cause the interest on such Bonds to continue to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 103(a) of the Code.

Section 4.07. Non-presentment of Bonds. In the event any Bond shall not be presented for payment when the principal thereof becomes due, whether at maturity, at the date fixed for redemption or otherwise, if moneys sufficient to pay such Bond shall have been made available to the Trustee for the benefit of the Registered Owner thereof, subject to the provisions of the immediately following paragraph, all liability of the City to the Registered Owner thereof for the payment of such Bond shall forthwith cease, determine and be completely discharged, and thereupon it shall be the duty of the Trustee to hold such moneys, without liability for interest thereon, for the benefit of the Registered Owner of such Bond who shall thereafter be restricted exclusively to such moneys, for any claim of whatever nature on his or her part under this Indenture or on, or with respect to, such Bond.

Any moneys so deposited with and held by the Trustee not so applied to the payment of Bonds within two years after the date on which the same shall have become due shall be repaid by the Trustee to the City, and thereafter the Registered Owners of such Bonds shall be entitled to look only to the City for payment, and then only to the extent of the amount so repaid, and all liability of the Trustee with respect to such moneys shall thereupon cease, and the City shall not be liable for any interest thereon and shall not be regarded as a trustee of such moneys. The obligation of the Trustee under this Section to pay any such funds to the City shall be subject, however, to any provisions of law applicable to the Trustee or to such funds providing other requirements for disposition of unclaimed property.
Section 4.08. Moneys Held in Trust. All moneys required to be deposited with or paid to the Trustee for the account of any fund or account referred to in any provision of this Indenture shall be held by the Trustee in trust as provided in Section 8.07 of this Indenture, and shall, while held by the Trustee, constitute part of the Trust Estate and be subject to the lien or security interest created hereby.

Moneys held in the funds, accounts and subaccounts established hereunder shall be invested and reinvested in accordance with the provisions governing investments contained in this Indenture.

DISCHARGE OF LIEN

Section 6.01. Defeasance. (a) If the City shall pay to the Registered Owners of the Bonds, or provide for the payment of, the principal, premium, if any, and interest to become due on the Bonds, then this Indenture and the Bond Ordinance shall be fully discharged and satisfied with respect to the Bonds. Upon the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the Trustee shall, upon the request of the City, execute and deliver to the City all such instruments as may be desirable to evidence such discharge and satisfaction, and all fiduciaries shall pay over or deliver to the City all funds, accounts and other moneys or securities held by them pursuant to this Indenture which are not required for the payment or redemption of the Bonds. If payment or provision for payment is made to or for the Registered Owners of all or a portion of the Bonds, of the principal of and interest due and to become due on any Bond at the times and in the manner stipulated therein, and there is paid or caused to be paid to the Trustee all sums of money due and to become due according to the provisions of this Indenture, then these presents and the estate and rights hereby and by the Bond Ordinance granted shall cease, terminate and be void as to those Bonds or portions thereof except for purposes of registration, transfer and exchange of Bonds and any such payment from such moneys or obligations. Any Bond shall be deemed to be paid within the meaning of this Section when payment of the principal of any such Bond, plus interest thereon to the due date thereof (whether such due date be by reason of maturity or upon redemption as provided in this Indenture or otherwise), either (a) shall have been made or caused to have been made in accordance with the terms thereof, or (b) shall have been provided for by irrevocably depositing with the Trustee, in trust and exclusively for such payment, (1) moneys sufficient to make such payment or (2) Defeasance Obligations, or (3) a combination of the investments described in clauses (1) and (2) above, such amounts so deposited being available or maturing as
to principal and interest in such amounts and at such times, without consideration of any reinvestment thereof, as will insure the availability of sufficient moneys to make such payment (all as confirmed by a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants). If the City shall pay and discharge a portion of the Bonds as aforesaid, such portion shall cease to be entitled to any lien, benefit or security under this Indenture and the Bond Ordinance. The liability of the City with respect to such Bonds shall continue, but the Registered Owners thereof shall thereafter be entitled to payment (to the exclusion of all other Bondholders) only out of the Defeasance Obligations deposited with the Trustee under Article VIII of this Indenture.

(b) No such deposit under this Section shall be made or accepted hereunder and no use made of any such deposit unless the Trustee shall have received an opinion of nationally recognized municipal bond counsel to the effect that such deposit and use would not cause any of such Bonds to be treated as "arbitrage bonds" within the meaning of Section 148 of the Code or any successor provision thereto.

(c) Nothing in this Indenture shall prohibit a defeasance deposit of escrow securities as provided in this Section from being subject to a subsequent sale of such escrow securities and reinvestment of all or a portion of the proceeds of that sale in escrow securities which, together with money to remain so held in trust, shall be sufficient to provide for payment of principal, redemption premium, if any, and interest on any of the defeased Bonds (all as confirmed by a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants). Amounts held by the Trustee in excess of the amounts needed so to provide for payment of the defeased Bonds may be subject to withdrawal by the City. No such sale and reinvestment as provided in this paragraph shall be made or accepted hereunder unless the Trustee shall have received an opinion of nationally recognized municipal bond counsel to the effect that such sale and reinvestment would not cause any of the defeased Bonds to be treated as "arbitrage bonds" within the meaning of Section 148 of the Code or any successor provision thereto.

ARTICLE VII

(c) Under no circumstance may the Trustee declare the principal of any Bond to be due and payable prior to its Maturity Date following the occurrence of an Event of Default under this Indenture.

The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or any Supplemental Indenture or of any Bonds issued hereunder or thereunder or in respect of the security afforded by this Indenture or any Supplemental Indenture and the Trustee shall not incur any responsibility in respect thereof.

In case an Event of Default has occurred and has not been remedied, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by law, this Indenture and each Supplemental Indenture and shall use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs. Any provision of this Indenture and any Supplemental Indenture relating to action taken or so to be taken by the Trustee or to evidence upon which the Trustee may rely shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.

The Trustee shall be protected in acting upon any notice, resolution, request, consent, order, certificate, report, opinion, bond or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine, and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Trustee may consult with counsel, who may or may not be counsel to the City, and the opinion of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken or suffered by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance therewith. Whenever the Trustee shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking or suffering any action hereunder, including payment of moneys out of any fund or account, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a Certificate, and such Certificate shall be full warrant for any action taken or suffered in good faith under the provisions of this Indenture upon the faith thereof, but in its discretion the Trustee may in lieu thereof accept other evidence of such fact or matter or may require such further or additional evidence as to it may seem reasonable. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or therein, any request, order, notice or other direction required or permitted to be furnished pursuant to any provision hereof or thereof by the City to the Trustee shall be sufficiently executed if executed in the name of the City by an Authorized Officer.

the Owners of Bonds or to effect or aid in any reorganization growing out of the enforcement of the Bonds or this Indenture, whether or not any such committee shall represent the Owners of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding.

Section 8.10. Resignation. The Trustee may at any time resign and be discharged of its duties and obligations created by this Indenture by giving not fewer than 60 days' written notice to the City and mailing notice thereof, to the Owners of Bonds at their addresses shown on the registration books kept by the Trustee within 20 days after the giving of such written notice. Such resignation shall take effect upon the appointment and acceptance of appointment of a successor by the City or the Owners of Bonds as herein provided.

Section 8.11. Removal. The Trustee may be removed at any time by the Owners of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding, excluding any Bonds held by or for the account of the City, by an instrument or concurrent instruments in writing signed and duly acknowledged by such Owners of Bonds or by their attorneys duly authorized in writing and delivered to the City. Copies of each such instrument shall be delivered by the City to the Trustee and any successor. The City may remove the Trustee at any time, except during the existence of an Event of Default, for such cause (or upon 30 days' notice for any reason) as shall be determined in the sole discretion of the City by filing with the Trustee an instrument signed by an Authorized Officer and by mailing notice thereof to the Owners of Bonds at their addresses shown on the registration books kept by the Trustee. Any removal of the Trustee shall take effect upon the appointment and acceptance of appointment of a successor Trustee.

Section 8.12. Appointment of Successor. In case at any time the Trustee shall resign or shall be removed or shall become incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or if a receiver, liquidator or conservator of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or if any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs, a successor may be appointed by the Owners of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding, excluding any Bonds held by or for the account of the City, by an instrument or concurrent instruments in writing signed by such Owners or their attorneys duly authorized in writing and delivered to such successor Trustee, notification thereof being given to the City and the predecessor Trustee. Pending such appointment, the City shall forthwith appoint a Trustee to fill such vacancy until a successor Trustee (if any) shall be appointed by the Owners of Bonds as herein authorized. The City shall mail notice to Owners of Bonds of any such appointment within 20 days after such appointment. Any successor Trustee appointed by the City shall, immediately and without further act, be superseded by a Trustee appointed by the Owners of Bonds. If in a proper case no appointment of a successor Trustee shall be made pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section within 45 days after the Trustee shall have given to the City written notice of resignation as provided in Section 8.10 hereof or after the occurrence of any other event requiring or authorizing such appointment, the Trustee, or any Owner of Bonds may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor. Said court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as said court may deem proper and prescribe, appoint such successor Trustee. Any Trustee appointed under the provisions of this Section shall be a bank, trust company or national banking association, in any such case having corporate trust powers, doing business and having a corporate trust office in the City.
Section 8.13. Transfer of Rights and Property to Successor. Any successor Trustee appointed under this Indenture shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to its predecessor Trustee, and also to the City, a written instrument of acceptance respecting such appointment, and thereupon such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become fully vested with all moneys, estates, properties, rights, powers, duties and obligations of such predecessor Trustee, with like effect as if originally named as Trustee; but the Trustee ceasing to act shall nevertheless, on the request of the City, or of the successor Trustee, execute, acknowledge and deliver such instruments of conveyance and further assurance and do such other things as may reasonably be required for more fully and certainly vesting and confirming in such successor Trustee all the right, title and interest of the predecessor Trustee in and to any property held by it under this Indenture, and shall pay over, assign and deliver to the successor Trustee any money or other property subject to the trusts and conditions herein set forth. Should any deed, conveyance or instrument in writing from the City be required by such successor Trustee for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee any such estates, rights, powers and duties, any and all such deeds, conveyances and instruments in writing shall, on request, and so far as may be authorized by law, be executed, acknowledged and delivered by the City.

Section 8.14. Merger or Consolidation. Any company into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated or any company resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which it shall be a party or any company to which the Trustee may sell or transfer all or substantially all of its corporate trust business, provided such company shall be a bank, trust company or national banking association which is qualified to be a successor to the Trustee under Section 8.12 hereof and shall be authorized by law to perform all the duties imposed upon it by this Indenture, shall be the successor to the Trustee without the execution or filing of any paper or the performance of any further act.

Section 8.15. Adoption of Authentication. In case any of the Bonds contemplated to be issued under this Indenture shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any successor Trustee may adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee so authenticating such Bonds and deliver such Bonds so authenticated, and in case any of the said Bonds shall not have been authenticated, any successor Trustee may authenticate such Bonds in the name of the predecessor Trustee, or in its own name.

Section 8.16. Evidence of Signatures of Owners and Ownership of Bonds. (a) Any request, consent or other instrument which this Indenture may require or permit to be signed and executed by the Owners of Bonds may be in one or more instruments of similar tenor, and shall be signed or executed by such Owners in person or by their attorneys appointed in writing. Proof of (i) the execution of any such instrument, or of an instrument appointing any such attorney, or (ii) the ownership by any person of the Bonds, shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture (except as otherwise herein expressly provided) if made in the following manner, but the Trustee may nevertheless in its discretion require further or other proof in cases where it deems the same desirable:

(1) The fact and date of the execution by any Owner or his attorney of such instrument may be proved by the certificate, which need not be acknowledged or verified, of an officer of a bank or trust company satisfactory to the Trustee or of any notary public
or other officer authorized to take acknowledgments of deeds to be recorded in the jurisdiction in which he purports to act, that the person signing such request or other instrument acknowledged to him the execution thereof, or by an affidavit of a witness of such execution, duly sworn to before such notary public or other officer.

(2) The authority of the person or persons executing any such instrument on behalf of a corporate Owner of Bonds may be established without further proof if such instrument is signed by a person purporting to be the president or vice president of such corporation with a corporate seal affixed and attested by a person purporting to be its secretary or an assistant secretary.

(b) The ownership of Bonds and the amount, numbers and other identification, and date of ownership of the same shall be proved by the Bond Register. Any request, consent or vote of the Owner of any Bond shall bind all future Owners of such Bond in respect of anything done or suffered to be done by the City or the Trustee in accordance therewith.

Section 8.17. Preservation and Inspection of Documents. All documents received by the Trustee under the provisions of this Indenture shall be retained in its possession and shall be subject at all reasonable times to the inspection of the City and any Owner of Bonds and their agents and their representatives, any of whom may make copies thereof.

(e) No Supplemental Indenture shall take effect unless and until there has been delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that such Supplemental Indenture does not adversely affect the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes to which interest on the Bonds would otherwise be entitled.

Section 9.04. Additional Matters. Additionally, this Indenture may, without the consent of, or notice to, any of the Bondholders, be supplemented and amended, in such manner as shall not be inconsistent with the terms and provisions hereof, for any one or more of the following purposes:

(a) to provide for certificated Bonds; and

(b) to secure or maintain ratings from any Rating Agency in the highest long term debt rating category, of such Rating Agency which are available for the Bonds, which changes will not restrict, limit or reduce the obligation of the City to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds as provided in this Indenture or otherwise adversely affect the Registered Owners of the Bonds under this Indenture.

Section 9.05. Mailing of Notice of Amendment. Any provision in this Article for the mailing of a notice or other paper to owners of Bonds shall be fully complied with if it is mailed postage prepaid only (i) to each Registered Owner of then Outstanding Bonds at his address, if any, appearing upon the registration books maintained by the City at the Designated Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and (ii) to the Trustee.

Section 9.06. Powers of Amendment. Any modification or amendment of this Indenture or of the rights and obligations of the City and of the Owners of the Bonds, in particular, which requires the consent of the Bondholders, may be made by a Supplemental Indenture, with the written consent given as provided in Section 9.07, (a) of the Owners of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds Outstanding at the time such consent is given, or (b) in case less than all of the then Outstanding Bonds are affected by the modification or amendment, of the Owners of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then Outstanding Bonds so affected. No such modification or amendment shall permit a change in the terms of redemption or maturity of the principal of any Outstanding Bonds or of any installment of interest thereon or a reduction in the principal amount or the Redemption Price thereof or in the rate of interest thereon, or in terms of purchase or the purchase price thereof, without the consent of the owner of such Bonds, or shall reduce the percentages or otherwise affect the classes of Bonds the consent of the owners of which is required to effect any such modification or amendment, or shall change or modify any of the rights or obligations of the Trustee without its written assent thereto. For the purposes of this Section, a Bond shall be deemed to be affected by a modification or amendment of this Indenture if the same adversely affects or diminishes the rights of the owners of such Bond.

Section 9.07. Consent of Owners of Bonds. (a) The City may at any time authorize a Supplemental Indenture making a modification or amendment permitted by the provisions of
Section 9.06, to take effect when and as provided in this Section. A copy of such Supplemental Indenture (or brief summary thereof or reference thereto in form approved by the Trustee), together with a request to the Owners of the Bonds for their consent thereto in form satisfactory to the Trustee, shall be mailed by the City to the Owners of the Bonds (but failure to mail such copy and request shall not affect the validity of the Supplemental Indenture when consented to as in this Section provided). Such Supplemental Indenture shall not be effective unless and until, and shall take effect in accordance with its terms when, (i) there shall have been filed with the Trustee (1) the written consents of Owners of the percentages of Outstanding Bonds specified in Section 9.06 and (2) an opinion of counsel stating that such Supplemental Indenture has been duly and lawfully executed and delivered by the City and the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, is authorized or permitted hereby and is valid and binding upon the City and enforceable in accordance with its terms upon its becoming effective as in this Section provided, and (ii) a notice shall have been mailed as hereinafter in this Section provided.

(b) The consent of an Owner of Bonds to any modification or amendment shall be effective only if accompanied by proof of the Ownership, at the date of such consent, of the Bonds with respect to which such consent is given, which proof shall be such as is permitted by Section 8.16. A certificate or certificates signed by the Trustee that it has examined such proof and that such proof is sufficient in accordance with Section 8.16 shall be conclusive that the consents have been given by the Owners of the Bonds described in such certificate or certificates. Any such consent shall be binding upon the Owner of the Bonds giving such consent and upon any subsequent Owner of such Bonds and of any Bonds issued in exchange therefor (whether or not such subsequent Owner thereof has notice thereof) unless such consent is revoked in writing by the Owner of such Bonds giving such consent or a subsequent Owner thereof by filing such revocation with the Trustee, prior to the time when the written statement of the Trustee hereinafter provided for in this Section is filed. The fact that a consent has not been revoked may likewise be proved by a certificate of the Trustee to the effect that no revocation thereof is on file with the Trustee.

(c) At any time after the Owners of the required percentages of Bonds shall have filed their consents to the Supplemental Indenture, the Trustee shall make and file with the City a written statement that the Owners of such required percentages of Bonds have filed such consents. Such written statement shall be conclusive that such consents have been so filed. At any time thereafter notice, stating in substance that the Supplemental Indenture (which may be referred to as a Supplemental Indenture entered into by the City and the Trustee as of a stated date, a copy of which is on file with the Trustee) has been consented to by the Owners of the required percentages of Bonds and will be effective as provided in this Section, shall be given to Owners by the Trustee by mailing such notice to the Owners of the Bonds (but failure to mail such notice shall not prevent such Supplemental Indenture from becoming effective and binding as provided in this Section). The Trustee shall file with the City proof of the mailing of such notice. A record, consisting of the papers required or permitted by this Section to be filed with the Trustee, shall be proof of the matters therein stated. Such Supplemental Indenture making such amendment or modification shall be deemed conclusively binding upon the Trustee and the Owners of all Bonds at the expiration of 40 days after the filing with the Trustee of proof of the mailing of such last mentioned notice, except in the event of a final decree of a court of competent jurisdiction setting aside such Supplemental Indenture in a legal action or equitable proceeding for such purpose commenced.
within such 40-day period; except that the Trustee and the City, during such 40-day period and any such further period during which any such action or proceeding may be pending, shall be entitled in their absolute discretion to take such action, or to refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Supplemental Indenture as they may deem expedient.

Section 9.08. Modifications by Unanimous Consent. The terms and provisions of this Indenture and the rights and obligations of the City and of the Owners of the Bonds hereunder may be modified or amended in any respect upon the consent of the Owners of all the then Outstanding Bonds to the execution and delivery of such Supplemental Indenture, such consent to be given as provided in Section 9.07 except that no notice to the Owners of the Bonds shall be required; but no such modification or amendment shall change or modify any of the rights or obligations of the Trustee without its written assent thereto.

Section 9.09. Exclusion of Bonds. Bonds owned by or for the account of the City shall not be deemed Outstanding for the purpose of consent or other action or any calculation of Outstanding Bonds provided for in this Article, and the City shall not be entitled with respect to such Bonds to give any consent or take any other action provided for in this Article. At the time of any consent or other action taken under this Article, the City shall furnish the Trustee with a Certificate upon which the Trustee may rely, describing all Bonds so to be excluded.

Section 9.10. Notation on Bonds. Bonds authenticated and delivered after the effective date of any action taken as in this Article provided may, and, if the Trustee so determines, shall, bear a notation by endorsement or otherwise in form approved by the City and the Trustee as to such action, and in that case upon demand of the Owner of any Bond Outstanding at such effective date and presentation of his Bond for that purpose at the Designated Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee or upon any exchange or registration of transfer of any Bond Outstanding at such effective date, suitable notation shall be made on such Bond or upon any Bond issued upon any such exchange or registration of transfer by the Trustee as to any such action. If the City or the Trustee shall so determine, new Bonds so modified as in the opinion of the Trustee and the City to conform to such action shall be prepared, authenticated and delivered, and upon demand of the Owner of any Bond then Outstanding shall be exchanged, without cost to such Owner, for Bonds of the same maturity upon surrender of such Bond.

If the Developer has not fulfilled its obligation, DPD will issue a written statement detailing the measures which must be taken in order to obtain them.

DPD may require a single inspection by an inspecting architect hired at the Developer's expense to confirm the completion of the Project. DPD shall make its best efforts to respond to Developer's written request for the Certificate within forty-five (45) days by issuing the Certificate or a written statement detailing the ways in which the Project does not conform to this Agreement or has not been satisfactorily completed, and the measures which must be taken by Developer in order to obtain the Certificate.

After the issuance of the Certificate, however, all executory terms and conditions of this Agreement and all representations and covenants contained herein unrelated to such work will remain in effect throughout the Term of the Agreement as to the parties described in the following paragraph, and the issuance of the Certificate shall not be construed as a waiver by the City of any of its rights and remedies pursuant to such executory terms.

Those covenants specifically described at Sections 6.02, 6.03, 6.04, 6.05, and 6.06 as covenants that run with the land will bind any transferee of the Property throughout the Term of the Agreement or such shorter period as may be explicitly provided for therein. The other executory terms of this Agreement shall be binding only upon the Developer or a permitted assignee of this Agreement.

5.03 Failure to Complete. If the Developer fails to complete the Project in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and/or if the Developer has not received the Certificate by the Certificate Deadline, the Certificate will not be issued, and the City will have the right to pursue any available legal remedies.

6.13 **Non-Governmental Charges.** The Developer agrees to pay or cause to be paid when due any Non-Governmental Charges. The Developer has the right, before any delinquency occurs, to contest any Non-Governmental Charge by appropriate legal proceedings properly and diligently prosecuted, so long as such proceedings serve to prevent any sale or forfeiture of the Property.
6.14 Governmental Charges.

(a) Payment of Governmental Charges. Developer agrees to pay or cause to be paid when due all Governmental Charges (as defined below) which are assessed or imposed upon Developer, the Property or the Project, or become due and payable, and which create, may create, a lien upon Developer or all or any portion of the Property or the Project. "Governmental Charge" shall mean all federal, State, county, the City, or other governmental (or any instrumentality, division, agency, body, or department thereof) taxes, levies, assessments, charges, liens, claims or encumbrances (except for those assessed by foreign nations, states other than the State of Illinois, counties of the State other than Cook County, and municipalities other than the City) relating to Developer, the Property or the Project including but not limited to real estate taxes.

(b) Right to Contest. Developer has the right before any delinquency occurs to contest or object in good faith to the amount or validity of any Governmental Charge by appropriate legal proceedings properly and diligently instituted and prosecuted in such manner as shall stay the collection of the contested Governmental Charge and prevent the imposition of a lien or the sale or forfeiture of the Property. No such contest or objection shall be deemed or construed in any way as relieving, modifying or extending Developer's covenants to pay any such Governmental Charge at the time and in the manner provided in this Agreement unless Developer has given prior written notice to DPD of Developer's intent to contest or object to a Governmental Charge and, unless, at DPD's sole option:

(i) Developer shall demonstrate to DPD's satisfaction that legal proceedings instituted by Developer contesting or objecting to a Governmental Charge shall conclusively operate to prevent or remove a lien against, or the sale or forfeiture of, all or any part of the Property to satisfy such Governmental Charge prior to final determination of such proceedings; and/or

(ii) Developer shall furnish a good and sufficient bond or other security satisfactory to DPD in such form and amounts as DPD shall require, or a good and sufficient undertaking as may be required or permitted by law to accomplish a stay of any such sale or forfeiture of the Property during the pendency of such contest, adequate to pay fully any such contested Governmental Charge and all interest and penalties upon the adverse determination of such contest.

6.15 Developer's Failure To Pay Or Discharge Lien. If Developer fails to pay any Governmental Charge or to obtain discharge of the same, Developer shall advise DPD thereof in writing, at which time DPD may, but shall not be obligated to, and without waiving or releasing any obligation or liability of Developer under this Agreement, in DPD's sole discretion, make such payment, or any part thereof, or obtain such discharge and take any other action with respect thereto which DPD deems advisable. All sums so paid by DPD, if any, and any expenses, if any, including reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, expenses and other charges relating thereto, shall be promptly disbursed to DPD by Developer; Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, this paragraph shall not be construed to obligate the City to pay any such Governmental Charge. Additionally, if Developer fails to pay any Governmental Charge, the City, in its sole discretion, may require Developer to submit to the City audited Financial Statements at Developer's own expense.
(a) **FOIA.** The Developer acknowledges that the City is subject to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act, 5 ILCS 140/1 et. seq., as amended ("FOIA"). The FOIA requires the City to produce records (very broadly defined in FOIA) in response to a FOIA request in a very short period of time, unless the records requested are exempt under the FOIA. If the Developer receives a request from the City to produce records within the scope of FOIA, then the Developer covenants to comply with such request within 48 hours of the date of such request. Failure by the Developer to timely comply with such request shall be an Event of Default.

(b) **Exempt Information.** Documents that the Developer submits to the City with the Annual Compliance Report or otherwise during the Term of the Agreement that contain trade secrets and commercial or financial information may be exempt if disclosure would result in competitive harm. However, for documents submitted by the Developer to be treated as a trade secret or information that would cause competitive harm, FOIA requires that Developer mark any such documents as "proprietary, privileged or confidential." If the Developer marks a document as "proprietary, privileged and confidential", then DPD will evaluate whether such document may be withheld under the FOIA. DPD, in its discretion, will determine whether a document will be exempted from disclosure, and that determination is subject to review by the Illinois Attorney General's Office and/or the courts.

(c) **Local Records Act.** The Developer acknowledges that the City is subject to the Local Records Act, 50 ILCS 205/1 et. seq, as amended (the "Local Records Act"). The Local Records Act provides that public records may only be disposed of as provided in the Local Records Act. If requested by the City, the Developer covenants to use its best efforts consistently applied to assist the City in its compliance with the Local Records Act.

**SECTION 7. MAINTAINING RECORDS AND RIGHT TO INSPECT**

7.01 **Books and Records.** The Developer, the general contractor and each subcontractor shall keep and maintain books and records that fully disclose the total actual cost of the Project and the disposition of all funds from whatever source allocated thereto and as otherwise necessary to evidence the Developer's compliance with its obligations under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, payroll records, general contractor's and subcontractors' sworn statements, general contracts, subcontracts, purchase orders, waivers of lien, paid receipts and invoices and the like. Such books and records shall be available at the applicable party's offices for inspection, copying, audit and examination by an authorized representative of the City, at the Developer's expense.

7.02 **Inspection Rights.** Upon three (3) business days' notice, any authorized representative of the City has access to all portions of the Project and the Property during normal business hours for the Term of the Agreement.
SECTION 8. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

The Developer hereby represents and warrants to the City that it has conducted environmental studies sufficient to conclude that the Project may be constructed, completed and operated in accordance with the requirements of all Environmental Laws and this Agreement. The Developer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the City harmless from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, injuries, costs, expenses or claims of any kind whatsoever including, without limitation, any losses, liabilities, damages, injuries, costs, expenses or claims asserted or arising under any Environmental Laws incurred, suffered by or asserted against the City and relating to the Project or the Property.

SECTION 9. INDEMNIFICATION

Developer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the City, its officers, officials, members, agents and employees harmless from and against any and all losses, costs, damages, liabilities, claims, suits, judgments, demands, actions, causes of action of every kind or nature and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and court costs) arising out of or incidental to the failure of Developer to perform its obligations under this Agreement. Upon reasonable notice from the City of any claim which the City believes to be covered hereunder, Developer shall timely appear in and defend all suits brought upon such claim and shall pay all costs and expenses incidental thereto, but the City shall have the right, at its option and at its own expense, to participate in the defense of any suit, without relieving Developer of any of its obligations hereunder. The obligations set forth in this section shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.

SECTION 10. DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

10.01 Events of Default. The occurrence of any one or more of the following events, subject to the provisions of Section 6 (Covenants, Representations, and Warranties of Developer), shall constitute an "Event of Default" by the Developer hereunder:

(a) the failure of Developer to complete the Project in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;

(b) the failure of the Developer to comply with any covenant or obligation, or the breach by the Developer of any representation or warranty, under this Agreement or any related agreement;

(c) the making or furnishing by Developer to the City of any representation, warranty, certificate, schedule, report or other communication within or in connection with this Agreement or any related agreement which is untrue or misleading in any material respect;

(d) the commencement of any bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or reorganization proceedings under any applicable state or federal law, or the commencement of any analogous statutory or non-statutory proceedings involving the Developer; provided, however, that if such commencement of proceedings is involuntary, such action shall not constitute an Event of Default unless such proceedings are not dismissed within sixty (60) days after the commencement of such proceedings;

(e) the appointment of a receiver or trustee for the Developer, for any substantial part of the Developer's assets or the institution of any proceedings for the dissolution, or the full or partial liquidation, or the merger or consolidation, of the Developer; provided, however, that if such appointment or commencement of proceedings is involuntary, such action shall not constitute an Event of Default unless
such appointment is not revoked or such proceedings are not dismissed within sixty (60) days after the commencement thereof;

(f) the entry of any judgment or order against the Developer or the Property which remains unsatisfied or undischarged and in effect for sixty (60) days after such entry without a stay of enforcement or execution; or

(g) the dissolution of the Developer or the death of any natural person who owns a 50% or more ownership interest in the Developer, unless, in the case of a death, the Developer establishes to the DPD's satisfaction that such death shall not impair the Developer's ability to perform its executory obligations under this Agreement.

10.02 Remedies. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the City may seek revocation of the Tax Incentive pursuant to the County Tax Incentive Ordinance, terminate this Agreement and all related agreements, and/or, in any court of competent jurisdiction by any action or proceeding at law or in equity, pursue and secure any other available remedy.

10.03 Cure Period. (a) In the event Developer shall fail to perform a monetary covenant which Developer is required to perform under this Agreement, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, an Event of Default shall not be deemed to have occurred unless Developer has failed to perform such monetary covenant within ten (10) days of its receipt of a written notice from the City specifying that it has failed to perform such monetary covenant.

(b) Developer shall be entitled to one 18-month cure period, which can be extended an additional six (6) months in the reasonable discretion of the Commissioner of DPD (for a total of 24 months), commencing on the date of issuance of the Certificate for failure to perform under Section 6.04 (Occupancy Covenant) and Section 6.05 (Jobs Covenant). Any cure period under this Section 10.03(b) shall not count toward the Compliance Period of this Agreement. If one failure to perform under either Section 6.04 or Section 6.05 has occurred and been cured as set forth in this Section 10.03(b), then any subsequent failure to perform under either Section 6.04 or Section 6.05 shall constitute an Event of Default.

(c) In the event Developer shall fail to perform any other non-monetary covenant which Developer is required to perform under this Agreement, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, an Event of Default shall not be deemed to have occurred unless Developer has failed to cure such default within thirty (30) days of its receipt of a written notice from the City specifying the nature of the default; provided, however, with respect to those non-monetary defaults which are not capable of being cured within such thirty (30) day period, Developer shall not be deemed to have committed an Event of Default under this Agreement if it has commenced to cure the alleged default within such thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently and continuously prosecutes the cure of such default until the same has been cured; provided, further, that there shall be no cure period under this Section 10.03 with respect to Developer's failure to comply with Section 6.03 (Operations Covenant).
SECTION 11. MORTGAGING OF THE PROJECT

If a mortgagee succeeds to Developer's interest in the Property or any portion thereof by exercising remedies under such mortgage, whether by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure, and in conjunction therewith accepts a written assignment of Developer's interest under this Agreement, the City agrees to attorn to and recognize such party as the successor in interest to Developer for all purposes under this Agreement so long as such party accepts all of the obligations and liabilities of Developer under this Agreement.

SECTION 12. GENERAL PROVISIONS

At the request of DPD, Developer shall erect a sign of size and style approved by the City in a conspicuous location on the Property during the Project, indicating the City's consent to the Tax Incentive.

4.04 Construction Compliance Informational Conference. Developer shall provide to the City a copy of the informational conference letter signed by DPD's construction and compliance division.

SECTION 5. COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION OR REHABILITATION

5.01 Certificate of Completion of Construction or Rehabilitation. Upon completion of the Project in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (and any requirements contained in the City Ordinance) and upon the Developer's written request, DPD shall issue to the Developer a Certificate of Completion of Construction or Rehabilitation (the "Certificate") in recordable form certifying that the Developer has fulfilled its obligation to complete the Project in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If the Developer has not fulfilled its obligation, DPD will issue a written statement detailing the measures which must be taken in order to obtain them.

DPD may require a single inspection by an inspecting architect hired at the Developer's expense to confirm the completion of the Project. DPD shall make its best efforts to respond to Developer's written request for the Certificate within forty-five (45) days by issuing the Certificate or a written statement detailing the ways in which the Project does not conform to this Agreement or has not been satisfactorily completed, and the measures which must be taken by Developer in order to obtain the Certificate. Developer may resubmit a written request for the Certificate upon completion of such measures.
The Developer acknowledges and understands that the City will not issue the Certificate, until the following conditions have been met:

- Evidence certified to and acceptable to DPD of the Final Project Cost demonstrating that the Developer has completed the Project in accordance with this Agreement and the Application and that it has made the Minimum Project Investment;
- Receipt of a Certificate of Occupancy or other evidence acceptable to DPD that the developer has complied with building permit requirements for Project;
- Evidence acceptable to DPD that the Project is in compliance with the Operations Covenant and the Occupancy Covenant;
- Evidence acceptable to DPD that the Developer, at its own expense, insured the Property in accordance with Exhibit C hereto, including Accord Form 27 certificates evidencing the required coverages; and

5.02 Continuing Obligations. The Certificate relates only to the respective performance of the work associated with the Project improvements. After the issuance of the Certificate, however, all executory terms and conditions of this Agreement and all representations and covenants contained herein unrelated to such work will remain in effect throughout the Term of the Agreement as to the parties described in the following paragraph, and the issuance of the Certificate shall not be construed as a waiver by the City of any of its rights and remedies pursuant to such executory terms.

Those covenants specifically described at Sections 6.02, 6.03, 6.04, 6.05 and 6.06 as covenants that run with the land will bind any transferee of the Property throughout the Term of the Agreement or such shorter period as may be explicitly provided for therein. The other executory terms of this Agreement shall be binding only upon the Developer or a permitted assignee of this Agreement.

5.03 Failure to Complete. If the Developer fails to complete the Project in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and/or if the Developer has not received the Certificate by the Certificate Deadline, the Certificate will not be issued, and the City will have the right to pursue any available legal remedies.

5.04 Notice of Expiration of Term of Agreement. Upon the expiration of the Term of the Agreement, DPD shall provide the Developer, at the Developer's written request, with a written notice in recordable form stating that the Term of the Agreement has expired.

If the Annual Compliance Report is not received within this timeframe, the City will notify Developer in writing of such deficiency. Thereafter, Developer shall have ten (10) days to file the Annual Compliance Report with DPD. Developer's failure to timely submit the Annual Compliance Report will constitute an event of default.

Developer represents that it understands and will abide by all provisions of Chapter 2-56 of the Municipal Code and that it will inform subcontractors of this provision and require their compliance.

6.13 Non-Governmental Charges. The Developer agrees to pay or cause to be paid when due any Non-Governmental Charges. The Developer has the right, before any delinquency occurs, to contest any Non-Governmental Charge by appropriate legal proceedings properly and diligently prosecuted, so long as such proceedings serve to prevent any sale or forfeiture of the Property.

6.14 Governmental Charges.

(a) Payment of Governmental Charges. Developer agrees to pay or cause to be paid when due all Governmental Charges (as defined below) which are assessed or imposed upon Developer, the Property or the Project, or become due and payable, and which create, may create, a lien upon Developer or all or any portion of the Property or the Project. "Governmental Charge" shall mean all federal, State, county, the City, or other governmental (or any instrumentality, division, agency, body, or department thereof) taxes, levies, assessments, charges, liens, claims or encumbrances (except for those assessed by foreign nations, states other than the State of Illinois, counties of the State other than Cook County, and municipalities other than the City) relating to Developer, the Property or the Project including but not limited to real estate taxes.

(b) Right to Contest. Developer has the right before any delinquency occurs to contest or object in good faith to the amount or validity of any Governmental Charge by appropriate legal proceedings properly and diligently instituted and prosecuted in such manner as shall stay the collection of the contested Governmental Charge and prevent the imposition of a lien or the sale or forfeiture of the Property. No such contest or objection shall be deemed or construed in any way as relieving, modifying or extending Developer's covenants to pay any such Governmental Charge at the time and in the manner provided in this Agreement unless Developer has given prior written notice to DPD of Developer's intent to contest or object to a Governmental Charge and, unless, at DPD's sole option:

(i) Developer shall demonstrate to DPD's satisfaction that legal proceedings instituted by Developer contesting or objecting to a Governmental Charge shall conclusively operate to prevent or remove a lien against, or the sale or forfeiture of, all or any part of the
Property to satisfy such Governmental Charge prior to final determination of such proceedings; and/or

(ii) Developer shall furnish a good and sufficient bond or other security satisfactory to DPD in such form and amounts as DPD shall require, or a good and sufficient undertaking as may be required or permitted by law to accomplish a stay of any such sale or forfeiture of the Property during the pendency of such contest, adequate to pay fully any such contested Governmental Charge and all interest and penalties upon the adverse determination of such contest.

6.15 Developer's Failure To Pay Or Discharge Lien. If Developer fails to pay any Governmental Charge or to obtain discharge of the same, Developer shall advise DPD thereof in writing, at which time DPD may, but shall not be obligated to, and without waiving or releasing any obligation or liability of Developer under this Agreement, in DPD's sole discretion, make such payment, or any part thereof, or obtain such discharge and take any other action with respect thereto which DPD deems advisable. All sums so paid by DPD, if any, and any expenses, if any, including reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, expenses and other charges relating thereto, shall be promptly disbursed to DPD by Developer. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, this paragraph shall not be construed to obligate the City to pay any such Governmental Charge. Additionally, if Developer fails to pay any Governmental Charge, the City, in its sole discretion, may require Developer to submit to the City audited Financial Statements at Developer's own expense.

6.16 FOIA and Local Records Act Compliance.

(a) FOIA. The Developer acknowledges that the City is subject to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act, 5 ILCS 140/1 et. seq., as amended ("FOIA"). The FOIA requires the City to produce records (very broadly defined in FOIA) in response to a FOIA request in a very short period of time, unless the records requested are exempt under the FOIA. If the Developer receives a request from the City to produce records within the scope of FOIA, then the Developer covenants to comply with such request within 48 hours of the date of such request. Failure by the Developer to timely comply with such request shall be an Event of Default.

(b) Exempt Information. Documents that the Developer submits to the City with the Annual Compliance Report or otherwise during the Term of the Agreement that contain trade secrets and commercial or financial information may be exempt if disclosure would result in competitive harm. However, for documents submitted by the Developer to be treated as a trade secret or information that would cause competitive harm, FOIA requires that Developer mark any such documents as "proprietary, privileged or confidential." If the Developer marks a document as "proprietary, privileged and confidential", then DPD will evaluate whether such document may be withheld under the FOIA. DPD, in its discretion, will determine whether a document will be exempted from disclosure, and that determination is subject to review by the Illinois Attorney General's Office and/or the courts.

(c) Local Records Act. The Developer acknowledges that the City is subject to the Local Records Act, 50 ILCS 205/1 et. seq, as amended (the "Local Records Act"). The Local Records Act provides that public records may only be disposed of as provided in the Local Records Act. If requested by the City,
the Developer covenants to use its best efforts consistently applied to assist the City in its compliance with the Local Records Act

SECTION 7. MAINTAINING RECORDS AND RIGHT TO INSPECT

7.01 Books and Records. The Developer, the general contractor and each subcontractor shall keep and maintain books and records that fully disclose the total actual cost of the Project and the disposition of all funds from whatever source allocated thereto and as otherwise necessary to evidence the Developer's compliance with its obligations under this Agreement, including, but not limited to, payroll records, general contractor's and subcontractors' sworn statements, general contracts, subcontracts, purchase orders, waivers of lien, paid receipts and invoices and the like. Such books and records shall be available at the applicable party's offices for inspection, copying, audit and examination by an authorized representative of the City, at the Developer's expense.

7.02 Inspection Rights. Upon three (3) business days' notice, any authorized representative of the City has access to all portions of the Project and the Property during normal business hours for the Term of the Agreement.

SECTION 8. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

The Developer hereby represents and warrants to the City that it has conducted environmental studies sufficient to conclude that the Project may be constructed, completed and operated in accordance with the requirements of all Environmental Laws and this Agreement. The Developer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the City harmless from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, injuries, costs, expenses or claims of any kind whatsoever including, without limitation, any losses, liabilities, damages, injuries, costs, expenses or claims asserted or arising under any Environmental Laws incurred, suffered by or asserted against the City and relating to the Project or the Property.

SECTION 9. INDEMNIFICATION

Developer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the City, its officers, officials, members, agents and employees harmless from and against any and all losses, costs, damages, liabilities, claims, suits, judgments, demands, actions, causes of action of every kind or nature and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and court costs) arising out of or incidental to the failure of Developer to perform its obligations under this Agreement. Upon reasonable notice from the City of any claim which the City believes to be covered hereunder, Developer shall timely appear in and defend all suits brought upon such claim and shall pay all costs and expenses incidental thereto, but the City shall have the right, at its option and at its own expense, to participate in the defense of any suit, without relieving Developer of any of its obligations hereunder. The obligations set forth in this section shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.
SECTION 10. DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

10.01. Events of Default. The occurrence of any one or more of the following events, subject to the provisions of Section 6 (Covenants, Representations, and Warranties of Developer), shall constitute an "Event of Default" by the Developer hereunder:

(a) the failure of Developer to complete the Project in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;

(b) the failure of the Developer to comply with any covenant or obligation, or the breach by the Developer of any representation or warranty, under this Agreement or any related agreement;

(c) the making or furnishing by Developer to the City of any representation, warranty, certificate, schedule, report or other communication within or in connection with this Agreement or any related agreement which is untrue or misleading in any material respect;

(d) the commencement of any bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or reorganization proceedings under any applicable state or federal law, or the commencement of any analogous statutory or non-statutory proceedings involving the Developer; provided, however, that if such commencement of proceedings is involuntary, such action shall not constitute an Event of Default unless such proceedings are not dismissed within sixty (60) days after the commencement of such proceedings;

(e) the appointment of a receiver or trustee for the Developer, for any substantial part of the Developer's assets or the institution of any proceedings for the dissolution, or the full or partial liquidation, or the merger or consolidation, of the Developer; provided, however, that if such appointment or commencement of proceedings is involuntary, such action shall not constitute an Event of Default unless such appointment is not revoked or such proceedings are not dismissed within sixty (60) days after the commencement thereof;

(f) the entry of any judgment or order against the Developer or the Property which remains unsatisfied or undischarged and in effect for sixty (60) days after such entry without a stay of enforcement or execution; or

(g) the dissolution of the Developer or the death of any natural person who owns a 50% or more ownership interest in the Developer, unless, in the case of a death, the Developer establishes to the DPD's satisfaction that such death shall not impair the Developer's ability to perform its executory obligations under this Agreement.

10.02 Remedies. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the City may seek revocation of the Tax Incentive pursuant to the County Tax Incentive Ordinance, terminate this Agreement and all related agreements, and/or, in any court of competent jurisdiction by any action or proceeding at law or in equity, pursue and secure any other available remedy.

10.03 Cure Period. (a) In the event Developer shall fail to perform a monetary covenant which Developer is required to perform under this Agreement, notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, an Event of Default shall not be deemed to have occurred unless Developer has failed to perform such monetary covenant within ten (10) days of its receipt of a written notice from the City specifying that it has failed to perform such monetary covenant.

(b) Developer shall be entitled to one 18-month cure period, which can be extended an additional six (6) months in the reasonable discretion of the Commissioner of DPD (for a total of 24 months), commencing on the date of issuance of the Certificate for failure to perform under Section 6.04 (Occupancy Covenant) and Section 6.05 (Jobs Covenant). Any cure period under this Section 10.03(b) shall not count toward the Compliance Period of this Agreement. If one failure to perform under either Section 6.04 or Section 6.05 has occurred and been cured as set forth in this Section 10.03(b), then any subsequent failure to perform under either Section 6.04 or Section 6.05 shall constitute an Event of Default.

(c) In the event Developer shall fail to perform any other non-monetary covenant which Developer is required to perform under this Agreement, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, an Event of Default shall not be deemed to have occurred unless Developer has failed to cure such default within thirty (30) days of its receipt of a written notice from the City specifying the nature of the default; provided, however, with respect to those non-monetary defaults which are not capable of being cured within such thirty (30) day period, Developer shall not be deemed to have committed an Event of Default under this Agreement if it has commenced to cure the alleged default within such thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently and continuously prosecutes the cure of such default until the same has been cured; provided, further, that there shall be no cure period under this Section 10.03 with respect to Developer's failure to comply with Section 6.03 (Operations Covenant).

SECTION 11. MORTGAGING OF THE PROJECT

If a mortgagee succeeds to Developer's interest in the Property or any portion thereof by exercising remedies under such mortgage, whether by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure, and in conjunction therewith accepts a written assignment of Developer's interest under this Agreement, the City agrees to attorn to and recognize such party as the successor in interest to Developer for all purposes under this Agreement so long as such party accepts all of the obligations and liabilities of Developer under this Agreement.

SECTION 12. GENERAL PROVISIONS

1. Bid Requirement For General Contractor And Subcontractors. Prior to entering into an agreement with a General Contractor or any subcontractor for construction of the Project, Developer shall solicit, or shall cause the General Contractor to solicit, bids from qualified contractors eligible to do business with, and having an office located in, the City of Chicago, and shall submit all bids received to DPD, if requested, for its inspection and written approval.

Construction Hiring Requirements.

1. Employment Opportunity. The Developer shall contractually obligate its or their various contractors, subcontractors or any Affiliate of the Developer operating on the Property (collectively, with the Developer, the "Employers" and individually an "Employer") to agree, that for the Term of this Agreement with respect to Developer and during the period of any other party's provision of services in connection with the construction of the Project or occupation of the Property:

(a) No Employer shall discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment based upon race, religion, color, sex, national origin or ancestry, age, handicap or disability, sexual orientation, military discharge status, marital status, parental status or source of income as defined in the City of Chicago Human Rights Ordinance, Chapter 2-160, Section 2-160-010, et seq., Municipal Code, except as otherwise provided by said ordinance and as amended from time to time (the "Human Rights Ordinance"). Each Employer shall take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are hired and employed without discrimination based upon race, religion, color, sex, national origin or ancestry, age, handicap or disability, sexual orientation, military discharge status, marital status, parental status or source of income and are treated in a non-discriminatory manner with regard to all job-related matters, including without limitation: employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training, including apprenticeship. Each Employer agrees to post in conspicuous places available to employees and
applicants for employment, notices to be provided by the City setting forth the provisions of this nondiscrimination clause. In addition, the Employers, in all solicitations or advertisements for employees, shall state that all qualified applicants shall receive consideration for employment without discrimination based upon race, religion, color, sex, national origin or ancestry, age, handicap or disability, sexual orientation, military discharge status, marital status, parental status or source of income.

(b) To the greatest extent feasible, each Employer is required to present opportunities for training and employment of low- and moderate-income residents of the City and preferably of the Area; and to provide those contracts for work in connection with the construction of the Project be awarded to business concerns that are located in, or owned in substantial part by persons residing in the City and preferably in the Area.

(c) Each Employer shall comply with all federal, state, and local equal employment and affirmative action statutes, rules, and regulations, including but not limited to the City's Human Rights Ordinance and the Illinois Human Rights Act, 775 ILCS 5/1-101, et seq. (1993), and any subsequent amendments and regulations promulgated thereto.

(d) Each Employer, in order to demonstrate compliance with the terms of this paragraph, shall cooperate with and promptly and accurately respond to inquiries by the City, which has the responsibility to observe and report compliance with equal employment opportunity regulations of federal, state and municipal agencies.

(e) Each Employer shall include the foregoing provisions of subparagraphs (a) through (d) in every contract entered into in connection with the Project and shall require inclusion of these provisions in every subcontract entered into by any subcontractors, and every agreement with any Affiliate operating on the Property, so that each such provision shall be binding upon each contractor, subcontractor or Affiliate, as the case may be.

(f) Failure to comply with the employment obligations described in this paragraph shall be a basis for the City to pursue its remedies under the Redevelopment Agreement.

2. Prevailing Wage. The Developer, the General Contractor and all subcontractors must pay the prevailing wage rate as ascertained by the Illinois Department of Labor (the "Department"), to all persons working on the Project. All such contracts shall list the specified rates to be paid to all laborers, workers and mechanics for each craft or type of worker or mechanic employed pursuant to such contract. If the Department revises such prevailing wage rates, the revised rates shall apply to all such contracts. Upon the City's request, the Developer shall provide the City with copies of all such contracts entered into by the Developer or the General Contractor to evidence compliance with this Prevailing Wage.

3. City Resident Construction Worker Employment Requirement. The Developer agrees for itself and its successors and assigns, and shall contractually obligate its General Contractor and shall cause the General Contractor to contractually obligate its subcontractors, as applicable, to agree, that during the construction of the Project they shall
comply with the minimum percentage of total worker hours performed by actual residents of the City as specified in Section 2-92-330 of the Municipal Code of Chicago (at least 50 percent of the total worker hours worked by persons on the site of the Project shall be performed by actual residents of the City); provided, however, that in addition to complying with this percentage, the Developer, its General Contractor and each subcontractor shall be required to make good faith efforts to utilize qualified residents of the City in both unskilled and skilled labor positions.

The Developer may request a reduction or waiver of this minimum percentage level of Chicagoans as provided for in Section 2-92-330 of the Municipal Code of Chicago in accordance with standards and procedures developed by the Chief Procurement Officer of the City.

"Actual residents of the City" shall mean persons domiciled within the City. The domicile is an individual's one and only true, fixed, and permanent home and principal establishment.

The Developer, the General Contractor and each subcontractor shall provide for the maintenance of adequate employee residency records to show that actual Chicago residents are employed on the Project. Each Employer shall maintain copies of personal documents supportive of every Chicago employee's actual record of residence.

Weekly certified payroll reports (U.S. Department of Labor Form WH-347 or equivalent) shall be submitted to the Commissioner of DPD in triplicate, which shall clearly identify the actual residence of every employee on each submitted certified payroll. The first time that an employee's name appears on a payroll, the date that the Employer hired the employee should be written in after the employee's name.

The Developer, the General Contractor and each subcontractor shall provide full access to their employment records to the Chief Procurement Officer, the Commissioner of DPD, the Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department, the Inspector General or any duly authorized representative of any of them. The Developer, the General Contractor and each subcontractor shall maintain all relevant personnel data and records for a period of at least three (3) years after final acceptance of the work constituting the Project.

At the direction of DPD, affidavits and other supporting documentation will be required of the Developer, the General Contractor, and each subcontractor to verify or clarify an employee's actual address when doubt or lack of clarity has arisen.

Good faith efforts on the part of the Developer, the General Contractor, and each subcontractor to provide utilization of actual Chicago residents (but not sufficient for the granting of a waiver request as provided for in the standards and procedures developed by the Chief Procurement Officer) shall not suffice to replace the actual, verified achievement of the requirements of this paragraph concerning the worker hours performed by actual Chicago residents.
When work at the Project is completed, in the event that the City has determined that the Developer has failed to ensure the fulfillment of the requirement of this paragraph concerning the worker hours performed by actual Chicago residents or failed to report in the manner as indicated above, the City will thereby be damaged in the failure to provide the benefit of demonstrable employment to Chicagoans to the degree stipulated in this paragraph. Therefore, in such a case of noncompliance, it is agreed that 1/20 of 1 percent (0.0005) of the aggregate hard construction costs set forth in the Project budget (the product of .0005 x such aggregate hard construction costs) (as the same shall be evidenced by approved contract value for the actual contracts) shall be surrendered by the Developer to the City in payment for each percentage of shortfall toward the stipulated residency requirement. Failure to report the residency of employees entirely and correctly shall result in the surrender of the entire liquidated damages as if no Chicago residents were employed in either of the categories. The willful falsification of statements and the certification of payroll data may subject the Developer, the General Contractor and/or the subcontractors to prosecution. Any retainage to cover contract performance that may become due to the Developer pursuant to Section 2-92-250 of the Municipal Code of Chicago may be withheld by the City pending the Chief Procurement Officer's determination as to whether the Developer must surrender damages as provided in this paragraph.

Nothing herein provided shall be construed to be a limitation upon the "Notice of Requirements for Affirmative Action to Ensure Equal Employment Opportunity, Executive Order 11246" and "Standard Federal Equal Employment Opportunity, Executive Order 11246", or other affirmative action required for equal opportunity under the provisions of this Agreement or related documents.

The Developer shall cause or require the provisions of this paragraph to be included in all construction contracts and subcontracts related to the Project.

4. MBE/WBE Commitment. The Developer agrees for itself and its successors and assigns, and, if necessary to meet the requirements set forth herein, shall contractually obligate the General Contractor to agree that, during the Project:

(a) Consistent with the findings which support the Minority-Owned and Women-Owned Business Enterprise Procurement Program (the "MBE/WBE Program"), Section 2-92-420, et seq., Municipal Code of Chicago, and in reliance upon the provisions of the MBE/WBE Program to the extent contained in, and as qualified by, the provisions of this paragraph 4, during the course of the Project, at least the following percentages of the MBE/WBE Budget attached hereto as (Sub)Exhibit B (as these budgeted amounts may be reduced to reflect decreased actual costs) shall be expended for contract participation by MBEs or WBEs:

i. At least 26 percent by MBEs; and

ii. At least 6 percent by WBEs.
(b) For purposes of MBE/WBE Commitment only, the Developer (and any party to whom a contract is let by the Developer in connection with the Project) shall be deemed a "contractor" and this Agreement (and any contract let by the Developer in connection with the Project) shall be deemed a "contract" as such terms are defined in Section 2-92-420, Municipal Code of Chicago.

(c) Consistent with Section 2-92-440, Municipal Code of Chicago, the Developer's MBE/WBE Commitment may be achieved in part by the Developer's status as an MBE or WBE (but only to the extent of any actual work performed on the Project by the Developer), or by a joint venture with one or more MBEs or WBEs (but only to the extent of the lesser of: (i) the MBE or WBE participation in such joint venture; or (ii) the amount of any actual work performed on the Project by the MBE or WBE), by the Developer utilizing an MBE or a WBE as a General Contractor (but only to the extent of any actual work performed on the Project by the General Contractor), by subcontracting or causing the General Contractor to subcontract a portion of the Project to one or more MBEs or WBEs, or by the purchase of materials used in the Project from one or more MBEs or WBEs, or by any combination of the foregoing. Those entities which constitute both an MBE and a WBE shall not be credited more than once with regard to the Developer's MBE/WBE Commitment as described in this paragraph 4. The Developer or the General Contractor may meet all or part of this commitment through credits received pursuant to Section 2-92-530 of the Municipal Code of Chicago for the voluntary use of MBEs or WBEs in its activities and operations other than the Project.

(d) Prior to the City's issuance of a Final Certificate, the Developer shall provide to DPD a final report describing its efforts to achieve compliance with this MBE/WBE Commitment. Such report shall include inter alia the name and business address of each MBE and WBE solicited by the Developer or the General Contractor to work on the Project, and the responses received from such solicitation, the name and business address of each MBE or WBE actually involved in the Project, a description of the work performed or products or services supplied, the date and amount of such work, product or service, and such other information as may assist DPD in determining the Developer's compliance with this MBE/WBE Commitment. DPD has access to the Developer's books and records, including, without limitation, payroll records, books of account and tax returns, and records and books of account in accordance with the Redevelopment Agreement, on five (5) business days' notice, to allow the City to review the Developer's compliance with its commitment to MBE/WBE participation and the status of any MBE or WBE performing any portion of the Project.

(e) Upon the disqualification of any MBE or WBE General Contractor or subcontractor, if such status was misrepresented by the disqualified party, the Developer shall be obligated to discharge or cause to be discharged the disqualified General Contractor or subcontractor and, if possible, identify and engage a qualified MBE or WBE as a replacement. For purposes of this subsection (e), the disqualification procedures are further described in Section 2-92-540, Municipal Code of Chicago.
(f) Any reduction or waiver of the Developer’s MBE/WBE Commitment as described in this paragraph 4 shall be undertaken in accordance with Section 2-92-450, Municipal Code of Chicago.

(g) Prior to the commencement of the Project, the Developer, the General Contractor, and all major subcontractors shall be required to meet with the monitoring staff of DPD with regard to the Developer’s compliance with its obligations under this Agreement. During this meeting, the Developer shall demonstrate to DPD its plan to achieve its obligations under this Agreement, the sufficiency of which shall be approved by DPD. During the Project, the Developer shall, upon the request of the monitoring staff of DPD, such interim reports as the monitoring staff may require. Failure to submit such documentation on a timely basis, or a determination by DPD, upon analysis of the documentation, that the Developer is not complying with its obligations hereunder shall, upon the delivery of written notice to the Developer, be deemed an Event of Default hereunder.

The following is said ordinance as passed:

WHEREAS, The City of Chicago ("City") is committed to addressing and preventing violence and discrimination against marginalized communities, including the transgender community; and

WHEREAS, Chicago is the deadliest city in the nation for Black trans women; and

WHEREAS, Trans-femicide, which is the killing of a trans woman because of her gender identity, especially when motivated by transmisogyny, is an example of violence and discrimination which the City should work against; and

WHEREAS, The concept of "chosen family", an idea which refers to a group of individuals who create deep emotional bonds and support systems, often transcending biological or legal ties, often as a result of rejection from a person's biological families due to their sexual orientation or gender identity, leading them to form alternative family structures based on love, acceptance, and mutual support, is recognized as essential within the transgender community, allowing friends and loved ones to celebrate each other's milestones and to support one another in times of crisis; and

WHEREAS, Chicago is home to many community organizations that are well-equipped to meet the needs of trans Chicagoans; and

WHEREAS, Many of those community organizations are under-resourced and are dealing with emergency conditions in the communities that they serve; and

WHEREAS, The resources currently present in Chicago's trans communities are insufficient to deal with the current threat of harm and death faced by the transgender and gender-diverse community; and

WHEREAS, The City acknowledges the importance of collaboration between various government agencies and community organizations in addressing violence and ensuring equity in policy and procedures; and

WHEREAS, The accurate reporting and tracking of hate incidents and hate crimes, including trans-femicide where the victim is Black, Indigenous, Latine, or a Person of Color, is essential to identifying trends and implementing effective measures to combat violence and discrimination; and

WHEREAS, City government seeks to act swiftly and effectively to provide help and support for our residents and employees; now, therefore,

(3) Members. The working group shall include, but not be limited to, representatives from the Mayor's Office; the Chicago Commission on Human Relations; the Department of Police; the Department of Family and Support Services, and the Chicago Department of Public Health.

(4) Stakeholder Participation.

The working group shall make best efforts to seek out the expertise and advice of community groups and organizations representing the transgender community, particularly Black, Indigenous, Latine, and People of Color, including the Advisory Council on LGBTQ+ issues created by Section 2-120-500(c) of the Municipal Code of Chicago; the gender-based violence task force created by Section 2-4-120 of the Municipal Code of Chicago; the Association of Latinos/as/xs Motivating Action ("ALMA"); Brave Space Alliance; Chicago Therapy Collective; Equality Illinois; Life Is Work; and Task ForceChicago.

(6) Community Meetings. The working group shall hold at least three community meetings to engage and solicit recommendations with the broader transgender community particularly Black, Indigenous, Latine, and People of Color. There shall be at least one community meeting held on the City’s South Side, West Side, and far North Side. The working group shall make reasonable efforts to advertise such meetings and engage in community outreach to ensure strong public participation in such meetings.

(7) Report. Within six months of its convening, the working group shall: (i) recommend data points for reports to the public for instances of trans-femicide, trans-femicide against BIPOC individuals, and hate crimes and hate incidents against transgender, gender-diverse, or non-binary individuals; and (ii) submit a written report to the Committee on Health and Human Relations, detailing its findings and recommendations, including any necessary amendments to existing policies and the Municipal Code of Chicago to combat trans-femicide, including against the BIPOC community, and an analysis of the violence against Black and Latine transgender women, gender-diverse, and non-binary individuals.

WHEREAS, According to research in 2020 by the office of Tolulope Akande-Sadipe, member of the Nigerian House of Representatives for Oyo State and Chair of the House Committee on Diaspora Affairs, perhaps 80,000 women from Nigeria alone have been trafficked as sex slaves across Lebanon, Mali, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates; and

WHEREAS, Terror-inspired massacres and displacement of innocent people are occurring simultaneously in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Libya, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, and Sudan; and

WHEREAS, Due to difficulty in obtaining accurate, in-depth information, as well as the mainstream media and human rights groups' typical disinterest in these atrocities, which they deem "sensitive" matters, it is highly likely that such slavery exists in other countries in North Africa; and

WHEREAS, It has been alleged, including references in publications such as The Guardian and Forbes, and supported by research conducted by Siddharth Kara -- an expert on modern-day slavery -- that American companies like Tesla, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Dell have benefited from exploitation and child labor in order to source cobalt and other minerals; now, therefore,

Be It Resolved, That we, the Mayor and members of the City Council of Chicago, stand in solidarity with all victims of modern-day slavery and call on the companies profiting from forced labor, cruelty and exploitation to operate in accordance with the United Nations' Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights; and

Be It Further Resolved, That the City of Chicago stands in humanitarian solidarity with all enslaved people, demanding their immediate liberation by every legal means possible.

WHEREAS, The City, through the foreclosure of demolition liens, tax sales and other methods of acquisition, has acquired title to thousands of parcels of vacant land which are costly to clean up and maintain, do not generate property taxes, and are a detriment to the community; and

WHEREAS, The City has traditionally sold much of its land directly to purchasers after receiving property inquiries, a method which is inefficient, labor-intensive and also lacks transparency; and

WHEREAS, In an effort to attract and reach potential buyers and create a more competitive process, the Department of Planning and Development (the "Department") created chiblockbuilder.com ("ChiBlockBuilder"), a website-based platform for selling vacant City-owned property with predetermined purchase prices and online application materials; and

WHEREAS, City lots sold through ChiBlockBuilder are offered for sale in different categories of use, such as affordable housing, market rate sales, missing middle-density housing, neighborhood side yards, community open space and urban agriculture; and

WHEREAS, ChiBlockBuilder allows perspective buyers to view a map of available properties and their associated land-use categories online, and apply to purchase lots for targeted purposes; and

WHEREAS, The Department retained the services of CBRE Group, Inc. to provide market value assessments of the available City-owned properties based on comparable sales, and these market value assessments are posted on the ChiBlockBuilder website to establish purchase prices for all properties marketed for sale; and

WHEREAS, The Department offered the properties identified on Exhibit A attached hereto (the "City Lots") for sale on the ChiBlockBuilder website for neighborhood side yards, with the goal of attracting property owners to fence and manage adjacent vacant property; and

WHEREAS, The Department accepted applications for the City Lots beginning on April 1, 2024 and ending on May 17, 2024 (the "Application Period"); and

WHEREAS, A public notice directing prospective applicants to ChiBlockBuilder for listings of City-owned properties for sale during the Application Period was published in the Chicago Tribune on April 1, April 8, April 15, April 22, April 29, May 6, May 13 and May 17, 2024; and
WHEREAS, Eligible side yard buyers had to meet the following qualifications: (1) own and live on property directly next to the City lot; (2) be able to maintain and care for the City lot; and (3) be able to pay property taxes on the City lot; and

WHEREAS, The Department reviewed the eligibility of ChiBlockBuilder side yard applications to confirm applicant ownership and residency and compliance with current zoning; and

WHEREAS, If there was more than one eligible ChiBlockBuilder side yard applicant, the Department held a randomized lottery open to the applicants to select the winner; and

WHEREAS, The Department selected buyers (each, a “Buyer”) for multiple City lots (each, a “City Lot”) in the side yards category; and

WHEREAS, The Department desires to convey each City Lot to the respective Buyer as identified on Exhibit A hereto, subject to a deed restriction requiring the Buyer to improve the City Lot as a landscaped side yard and own the property for a minimum of five years after closing; and

WHEREAS, The Buyers have agreed to purchase the City Lots for the purchase prices listed on Exhibit A (each, a “Purchase Price”), which represent 10 percent of the market value assessment for the applicable City Lots; now, therefore,

Be It Ordained by the City Council of the City of Chicago:

SECTION 1. The foregoing recitals, findings and statements of fact are incorporated herein and made a material part of this ordinance.

SECTION 2. The City Council hereby approves the sale of each City Lot to the respective Buyers identified on Exhibit A hereto in its “as is” condition for the Purchase Prices listed on Exhibit A.

SECTION 3. The Mayor or the Mayor’s proxy is authorized to execute, and the City Clerk or the Deputy City Clerk is authorized to attest, quitclaim deeds (each, a “Deed”) conveying the City Lots to the respective Buyers, or to a land trust of which the Buyer is the sole beneficiary, or to an entity of which the Buyer is the sole controlling party or which is comprised of the same principal parties. Without limiting the quitclaim nature of each Deed, the conveyance of each City Lot shall be subject to the following: the standard exceptions in an ALTA title insurance policy; general real estate taxes and any special assessments or other taxes; easements, encroachments, covenants, restrictions and liens of record and not shown of record; such other title defects as may exist; and any and all exceptions caused by the acts of the Buyer or the Buyer’s agents. In addition, the Deed shall include the following terms, covenants and conditions, in substantially the form set forth below, which are a part of the consideration for each City Lot and which shall run with the land and be binding upon and enforceable against the Buyer and the Buyer’s heirs, successors and assigns, in perpetuity (unless a shorter period is expressly stated below):
1. Covenant To Improve Side Yard With Landscaped Open Space; Restriction On Conveyance. Buyer: (a) shall improve and maintain the City Lot with landscaped open space (meaning grass, cultivated ornamental shrubs, plants, trees or a combination thereof) within six (6) months of the date of this Deed, provided that plantings may be delayed for an additional six (6) months if consistent with good landscaping practices; (b) shall maintain the City Lot in accordance with the provisions of the Municipal Code of Chicago; and (c) shall not convey, assign or otherwise transfer the City Lot.

If any of these conditions are not satisfied, the City may record a notice of default against the City Lot and shall have the right to exercise any and all remedies available to it at law or in equity, including the right to re-enter the City Lot and revest title in the City. Buyer, at the request of the City, covenants to execute and deliver to the City a reconveyance deed to the City Lot to further evidence such revesting of title. This right of reverter in favor of the City shall terminate five (5) years following the date of this Deed.

2. Environmental Documents Review. The City, acting through its Bureau of Environmental, Health and Safety Management in the Department of Fleet and Facility Management ("Bureau"), has conducted a limited review ("Limited Review") of certain City records and other information ("Review Documents") in an effort to identify potential environmental concerns associated with the City Lot. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer has previously received a summary of the Bureau's Limited Review, and that the City has made all Review Documents available to Buyer for inspection and copying upon request.

3. Limited Nature Of City's Limited Review. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the City does not represent or warrant that the Bureau's methodology for or findings from its Limited Review are accurate or complete or that the environmental condition of or risks to the City Lot are consistent with the Bureau's summary of its Limited Review. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the City did not perform a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment or conduct a thorough environmental investigation of the City Lot, and that the City's review of the Review Documents was limited. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Bureau's Limited Review may not have located all City, publicly available, or other documents or information relating to the condition of the City Lot, and that there may be other conditions, uses, and sources or types of contamination affecting the City Lot. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the City is not obligated to locate all such documentation or information or to perform any environmental investigation or evaluation of the City Lot.

4. Historic Contamination Of Urban Land. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that properties in urban areas, including Chicago, are frequently impacted by historical conditions and uses that may not be documented in the Review Documents, such as: a) buried demolition debris containing lead-based paint or asbestos; (b) underground heating oil tanks; (c) off-site migration of chemicals from existing or former gas stations, dry cleaners, metal finishing operations, lumber treatment facilities, and other commercial, industrial or manufacturing land uses; (d) illegal dumping; (e) nearby railroad operations; and (f) airborne deposit of lead and other contaminants from
historical use of lead gasoline and surrounding industries. Buyer acknowledges receipt of a fact sheet prepared by the United States Environmental Protection Agency about urban gardening best management practices to prevent or reduce exposure to contaminants that may be present in soils, "Reusing Potentially Contaminated Landscapes: Growing Gardens in Urban Soils", EPA 542/F-10/011 (Spring 2011).

5. "As Is", "Where Is" And "With All Faults" Conveyance. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer has had an opportunity to inspect the City Lot and is relying solely upon Buyer's own inspection and other due diligence activities that Buyer may have conducted in determining whether to acquire the City Lot, and not upon any information provided by or on behalf of the City with respect thereto, including, without limitation, the Limited Review, the Review Documents and any summary thereof. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the City Lot is being conveyed, and Buyer accepts the City Lot, in its "As Is", "Where Is" and "With All Faults" condition without any covenant, representation, or warranty, express or implied, of any kind, regarding the physical or environmental condition of the City Lot or the suitability of the City Lot for any purpose whatsoever. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer is solely responsible for any investigation and remediation work necessary to put the City Lot in a condition which is suitable for its intended use.

6. Release Of City. Buyer, on behalf of Buyer and Buyer's heirs, transferees, successors and assigns, and anyone claiming by, through or under any of them, hereby releases, relinquishes and forever discharges Granter and its officers, employees, agencies, departments, officials, agents, representatives, contractors and consultants, from and against any and all claims, demands, losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and court costs) based upon, arising out of or in any way connected with, directly or indirectly, the environmental or physical condition of the City Lot.

7. Affordable Housing And Municipal Code Requirements. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the sale of City-owned land may trigger Section 2-44-085 of the Municipal Code of Chicago (currently and as hereafter amended, supplemented or replaced, the "Affordable Requirements Ordinance"), and therefore, that a future residential project on the City Lot may be subject to the requirements of the Affordable Requirements Ordinance. Buyer also acknowledges and agrees that other provisions of the Municipal Code of Chicago (currently and as hereafter amended, supplemented or replaced) apply to the City Lot and Buyer's use, maintenance, and transfer of the City Lot.

SECTION 4. The Commissioner of the Department ("Commissioner"), or a designee of the Commissioner, is each hereby authorized, with the approval of the City's Corporation Counsel as to form and legality, to negotiate, execute and deliver such documents as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out and comply with the provisions of this ordinance, with such changes, deletions and insertions as shall be approved by the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee. Such documents may contain terms and provisions that the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee deems appropriate, including indemnification, releases, affidavits and other documents as may be reasonably necessary to remove exceptions from title with respect to the City Lot or otherwise may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to consummate the transaction contemplated hereby.
SECTION 5. If any provision of this ordinance shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect any of the other provisions of this ordinance.

SECTION 6. This ordinance shall take effect upon its passage and approval.

Alexander Streer, Chicago, IL 60616.

Without limiting the quitclaim nature of this deed, this conveyance is subject to: (a) the standard exceptions in an ALTA title insurance policy; (b) general real estate taxes and any special assessments or other taxes; (c) all easements, encroachments, covenants and restrictions of record and not shown of record; (d) such other title defects that may exist; and (e) any and all exceptions caused by the acts of Buyer or its agents.

In addition, this conveyance is subject to the following terms, covenants and
conditions which are a part of the consideration for the City Lot and which shall run with
the land and be binding upon and enforceable against the Buyer and the Buyer's heirs,
successors and assigns, in perpetuity (unless a shorter period is expressly stated below):

1. **Covenant to Improve City Lot with Project; Restriction on Conveyance.**
   Buyer shall (a) commence construction of the project described in Buyer's
   ChiBlockBuilder application and approved by the City's Department of Planning
   and Development within three (3) months from the date of this Deed, and complete
   construction of the project within twelve (12) months after construction
   commencement, provided, however, the Department, in its reasonable discretion,
   may extend the project commencement and completion dates, (b) maintain the
   City Lot in accordance with the provisions of the Municipal Code of Chicago; and
   (c) not convey, assign, or otherwise transfer the City Lot until construction is

   to re-enter the City Lot and revest title in the City. Buyer, at the request of the City,
   covenants to execute and deliver to the City a reconveyance deed to the City Lot
   to further evidence such revesting of title. This right of reverter in favor of the City
   shall terminate at construction completion.

2. **Environmental Documents Review.** The City, acting through its Bureau of
   Environmental, Health and Safety Management in the Department of Fleet and
   Facility Management ("Bureau"), has conducted a limited review ("Limited
   Review") of certain City records and other information ("Review Documents") in an
   effort to identify potential environmental concerns associated with the City Lot.
   Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer has previously received a summary
   of the Bureau's Limited Review, and that the City has made all Review Documents
   available to Buyer for inspection and copying upon request.

3. **Limited Nature of City's Review.** Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the City
   does not represent or warrant that the Bureau's methodology for or findings from
   its Limited Review are accurate or complete or that the environmental condition of
   or risks to the City Lot are consistent with the Bureau's summary of its Limited
   Review. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the City did not perform a Phase I
   Environmental Site Assessment or conduct a thorough environmental investigation
   of the City Lot, and that the City's review of the Review Documents was limited.
   Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Bureau's Limited Review may not have
   located all City, publicly available, or other documents or information relating to the
   condition of the City Lot, and that there may be other conditions, uses, and sources
   or types of contamination affecting the City Lot. Buyer acknowledges and agrees
that the City is not obligated to locate all such documentation or information or to perform any environmental investigation or evaluation of the City Lot.

4. **Historic Contamination of Urban Land.** Buyer acknowledges and agrees that properties in urban areas, including Chicago, are frequently impacted by historical conditions and uses that may not be documented in the Review Documents, such as (a) buried demolition debris containing lead-based paint or asbestos, (b) underground heating oil tanks, (c) off-site migration of chemicals from existing or former gas stations, dry cleaners, metal finishing operations, lumber treatment facilities, and other commercial, industrial or manufacturing land uses, (d) illegal dumping, (e) nearby railroad operations, and (f) airborne deposit of lead and other contaminants from historical use of lead gasoline and surrounding industries. Buyer acknowledges receipt of a fact sheet prepared by the United States Environmental Protection Agency about urban gardening best management practices to prevent or reduce exposure to contaminants that may be present in soils, "Reusing Potentially Contaminated Landscapes: Growing Gardens in Urban Soils," EPA 542/F-10/011 (Spring 2011).

5. **"As Is," "Where Is" and "With All Faults" Conveyance.** Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer has had an opportunity to inspect the City Lot and is relying solely upon Buyer's own inspection and other due diligence activities that Buyer may have conducted in determining whether to acquire the City Lot, and not upon any information provided by or on behalf of the City with respect thereto, including without limitation, the Limited Review, the Review Documents and any summary thereof. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the City Lot is being conveyed, and Buyer accepts the City Lot, in its "AS IS," "WHERE IS" and "WITH ALL FAULTS" condition without any covenant, representation, or warranty, express or implied, of any kind, regarding the physical or environmental condition of the City Lot or the suitability of the City Lot for any purpose whatsoever. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer is solely responsible for any investigation and remediation work necessary to put the City Lot in a condition which is suitable for its intended use.

6. **Affordable Housing and Municipal Code Requirements.** Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the sale of City-owned land may trigger Section 2-44-085 of the Municipal Code of Chicago (currently and as hereafter amended, supplemented or replaced, the "Affordable Requirements Ordinance"), and therefore, that a future residential project on the City Lot may be subject to the requirements of the Affordable Requirements Ordinance. Buyer also acknowledges and agrees that other provisions of the Municipal Code of Chicago (currently and as hereafter amended, supplemented or replaced) apply to the City Lot and Buyer's use, maintenance, and transfer of the City Lot.

7. **Release of City.** Buyer, on behalf of Buyer and Buyer's heirs, transferees, successors and assigns, and anyone claiming by, through or under any of them,
hereby releases, relinquishes and forever discharges Grantor and its officers, employees, agencies, departments, officials, agents, representatives, contractors and consultants, from and against any and all claims, demands, losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and court costs) based upon, arising out of or in any way connected with, directly or indirectly, the environmental or physical condition of the City Lot.

WHEREAS, The City of Chicago ("City") is a home rule unit of government by virtue of the provisions of the Constitution of the State of Illinois of 1970 and, as such, may exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and

WHEREAS, The City, through the foreclosure of demolition liens, tax sales and other methods of acquisition, has acquired title to thousands of parcels of vacant land which are costly to clean up and maintain, do not generate property taxes, and are a detriment to the community; and

WHEREAS, The City has traditionally sold much of its land directly to purchasers after receiving property inquiries, a method which is inefficient, labor-intensive and also lacks transparency; and

WHEREAS, In an effort to attract and reach potential buyers and create a more competitive process, the Department of Planning and Development (the "Department") created chiblockbuilder.com ("ChiBlockBuilder"), a website-based platform for selling vacant City-owned property with predetermined purchase prices and online application materials; and

WHEREAS, City lots sold through ChiBlockBuilder are offered for sale in different categories of use, such as affordable housing, market rate sales, missing middle-density housing, neighborhood side yards, community open space, and urban agriculture; and

WHEREAS, ChiBlockBuilder allows prospective buyers to view a map of available properties and their associated land use categories online, and apply to purchase lots for targeted purposes; and

WHEREAS, The Department retained the services of CBRE Group, Inc. to provide market value assessments of the available City-owned properties based on comparable sales, and these market value assessments are posted on the ChiBlockBuilder website to establish purchase prices for all properties marketed for sale; and

WHEREAS, The Department offered the properties identified on Exhibit A attached hereto (the "City Lots") for sale on the ChiBlockBuilder website for market rate development; and

WHEREAS, The Department accepted applications for the City Lots beginning on April 1, 2024 and ending on May 17, 2024 and July 1, 2024 (the "Application Period"); and

WHEREAS, A public notice directing prospective applicants to ChiBlockBuilder for listings of City-owned properties for sale during the Application Period was published in the Chicago Tribune on April 1, 8, 15, 22, 29; May 6, 13, 20, 27; and June 3, 10, 17, 24 of 2024; and
WHEREAS, Eligible buyers of the City Lots had to meet the following qualifications: (1) be individuals, nonprofit organizations or businesses registered in Illinois; (2) submit a site plan, budget and program for the project; (3) conform to Neighborhood Design Guidelines; (4) show support from the nearby community for the project; (5) provide an analysis of the impact of the project on the immediate area and surrounding community; (6) be able to pay property taxes on the City Lot and have no outstanding debt with the City; (7) be able to conform with current zoning requirements or secure required zoning approvals and permits; and (8) be able to maintain the City Lot as proposed in the application materials; and

WHEREAS, The Department evaluated the applications for the City Lots based on the following criteria: the applicant's development experience, clarity and feasibility of project plans and designs, practicality of project timeline, budget detail, proof of funding, purchase price, public benefit of project, community engagement and consistency of project with neighborhood plans; and

WHEREAS, The Department selected the buyers identified on Exhibit A (each, a "Buyer") for the projects described on Exhibit A; and

WHEREAS, The names of all applicants for each City Lot, the names of the finalists, and a summary of the finalist proposals are set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto; and

WHEREAS, The Department desires to convey each City Lot to the respective Buyer subject to a deed restriction requiring the Buyer to improve the City Lot as proposed in their application materials; and

WHEREAS, The Buyers have agreed to purchase the City Lots for the purchase prices listed on Exhibit A (each, a "Purchase Price"); and

WHEREAS, The Buyers acknowledge that its project will require a variation from the Chicago Zoning Board of Appeals to allow a three-unit apartment to be built; now, therefore,

Be It Ordained by the City Council of the City of Chicago:

SECTION 1. The foregoing recitals, findings and statements of fact are incorporated herein and made a material part of this ordinance.

SECTION 2. The City Council hereby approves the sale of each City Lot in its "as is" condition to the Buyers identified on Exhibit A for the Purchase Prices listed on Exhibit A.

SECTION 3. The Mayor or the Mayor's proxy is authorized to execute, and the City Clerk or the Deputy City Clerk is authorized to attest, quitclaim deeds (each, a "Deed") conveying the City Lots to the respective Buyers, or to a land trust of which the Buyer is the sole beneficiary, or to an entity of which the Buyer is the sole controlling party or which is comprised of the same principal parties.

Alderperson Harris moved to reconsider the foregoing vote. The motion was lost.
The following is said ordinance as passed:

WHEREAS, The City of Chicago ("City") is a home rule unit of government by virtue of the provisions of the Constitution of the State of Illinois of 1970 and, as such, may exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and

WHEREAS, The City, through the foreclosure of demolition liens, tax sales and other methods of acquisition, has acquired title to thousands of parcels of vacant land which are costly to clean up and maintain, do not generate property taxes, and are a detriment to the community; and

WHEREAS, The City has traditionally sold much of its land directly to purchasers after receiving property inquiries, a method which is inefficient, labor-intensive and also lacks transparency; and

WHEREAS, In an effort to attract and reach potential buyers and create a more competitive process, the Department of Planning and Development (the "Department") created chiblockbuilder.com ("ChiBlockBuilder"), a website-based platform for selling vacant City-owned property with predetermined purchase prices and online application materials; and

WHEREAS, City lots sold through ChiBlockBuilder are offered for sale in different categories of use, such as affordable housing, market rate sales, missing middle-density housing, neighborhood side yards, community open space and urban agriculture; and

WHEREAS, ChiBlockBuilder allows prospective buyers to view a map of available properties and their associated land use categories online, and apply to purchase lots for targeted purposes; and

WHEREAS, The Department retained the services of CBRE Group, Inc. to provide market value assessments of the available City-owned properties based on comparable sales, and these market value assessments are posted on the ChiBlockBuilder website to establish purchase prices for all properties marketed for sale; and

WHEREAS, The Department offered the properties identified on Exhibit A attached hereto (the "City Lots") for sale on the ChiBlockBuilder website for neighborhood side yards, with the goal of attracting property owners to fence and manage adjacent vacant property; and

WHEREAS, The Department accepted applications for the City Lots beginning on April 1, 2024 and ending on May 17, 2024 (the "Application Period"); and

WHEREAS, A public notice directing prospective applicants to ChiBlockBuilder for listings of City-owned properties for sale during the Application Period was published in the Chicago Tribune on April 1, April 8, April 15, April 22, April 29, May 6, May 13 and May 17, 2024; and
WHEREAS, Eligible side yard buyers had to meet the following qualifications: (1) own and live on property directly next to the City lot; (2) be able to maintain and care for the City lot; and (3) be able to pay property taxes on the City lot; and

WHEREAS, The Department reviewed the eligibility of ChiBlockBuilder side yard applications to confirm applicant ownership and residency and compliance with current zoning; and

WHEREAS, If there was more than one eligible ChiBlockBuilder side yard applicant, the Department held a randomized lottery open to the applicants to select the winner; and

WHEREAS, The Department selected buyers (each, a “Buyer”) for multiple City lots (each, a “City Lot”) in the side yards category; and

WHEREAS, The Department desires to convey each City Lot to the respective Buyer as identified on Exhibit A hereto, subject to a deed restriction requiring the Buyer to improve the City Lot as a landscaped side yard and own the property for a minimum of five years after closing; and

WHEREAS, The Buyers have agreed to purchase the City Lots for the purchase prices listed on Exhibit A (each, a “Purchase Price”), which represent 10 percent of the market value assessment for the applicable City Lots; now, therefore,

Be It Ordained by the City Council of the City of Chicago:

SECTION 1. The foregoing recitals, findings and statements of fact are incorporated herein and made a material part of this ordinance.

SECTION 2. The City Council hereby approves the sale of each City Lot to the respective Buyers identified on Exhibit A hereto in its “as is” condition for the Purchase Prices listed on Exhibit A.

SECTION 3. The Mayor or the Mayor’s proxy is authorized to execute, and the City Clerk or the Deputy City Clerk is authorized to attest, quitclaim deeds (each, a “Deed”) conveying the City Lots to the respective Buyers, or to a land trust of which the Buyer is the sole beneficiary, or to an entity of which the Buyer is the sole controlling party or which is comprised of the same principal parties. Without limiting the quitclaim nature of each Deed, the conveyance of each City Lot shall be subject to the following: the standard exceptions in an ALTA title insurance policy; general real estate taxes and any special assessments or other taxes; easements, encroachments, covenants, restrictions and liens of record and not shown of record; such other title defects as may exist; and any and all exceptions caused by the acts of the Buyer or the Buyer’s agents. In addition, the Deed shall include the following terms, covenants and conditions, in substantially the form set forth below, which are a part of the consideration for each City Lot and which shall run with the land and be binding upon and enforceable against the Buyer and the Buyer’s heirs, successors and assigns, in perpetuity (unless a shorter period is expressly stated below):
1. Covenant To Improve Side Yard With Landscaped Open Space; Restriction On Conveyance. Buyer: (a) shall improve and maintain the City Lot with landscaped open space (meaning grass, cultivated ornamental shrubs, plants, trees or a combination thereof) within six (6) months of the date of this Deed, provided that plantings may be delayed for an additional six (6) months if consistent with good landscaping practices; (b) shall not construct any permanent improvements on the City Lot, excluding additions to Buyer's primary residence or a garage appurtenant thereto; (c) shall maintain the City Lot in accordance with the Municipal Code of Chicago; and (d) shall not convey, assign or otherwise transfer the City Lot. These conditions shall run with the land and be in full force and effect for a period of five (5) years from the date of this Deed. If any of these conditions are not satisfied, the City may record a notice of default against the City Lot and shall have the right to exercise any and all remedies available to it at law or in equity, including the right to re-enter the City Lot and revest title in the City. Buyer, at the request of the City, covenants to execute and deliver to the City a reconveyance deed to the City Lot to further evidence such revesting of title. This right of reverter in favor of the City shall terminate five (5) years following the date of this Deed.

2. Environmental Documents Review. The City, acting through its Bureau of Environmental, Health and Safety Management in the Department of Fleet and Facility Management ("Bureau"), has conducted a limited review ("Limited Review") of certain City records and other information ("Review Documents") in an effort to identify potential environmental concerns associated with the City Lot. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer has previously received a summary of the Bureau's Limited Review, and that the City has made all Review Documents available to Buyer for inspection and copying upon request.

3. Limited Nature Of City's Limited Review. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the City does not represent or warrant that the Bureau's methodology for or findings from its Limited Review are accurate or complete or that the environmental condition of or risks to the City Lot are consistent with the Bureau's summary of its Limited Review. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the City did not perform a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment or conduct a thorough environmental investigation of the City Lot, and that the City's review of the Review Documents was limited. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Bureau's Limited Review may not have located all City, publicly available, or other documents or information relating to the condition of the City Lot, and that there may be other conditions, uses, and sources or types of contamination affecting the City Lot. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the City is not obligated to locate all such documentation or information or to perform any environmental investigation or evaluation of the City Lot.

4. Historic Contamination Of Urban Land. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that properties in urban areas, including Chicago, are frequently impacted by historical
conditions and uses that may not be documented in the Review Documents, such as:
(a) buried demolition debris containing lead-based paint or asbestos; (b) underground
heating oil tanks; (c) off-site migration of chemicals from existing or former gas
stations, dry cleaners, metal finishing operations, lumber treatment facilities, and other
commercial, industrial or manufacturing land uses; (d) illegal dumping; (e) nearby
railroad operations; and (f) airborne deposit of lead and other contaminants from
historical use of lead gasoline and surrounding industries. Buyer acknowledges receipt
of a fact sheet prepared by the United States Environmental Protection Agency about
urban gardening best management practices to prevent or reduce exposure to
contaminants that may be present in soils, "Reusing Potentially Contaminated
Landscapes: Growing Gardens in Urban Soils", EPA 542/F-10/011 (Spring 2011).

5. "As Is", "Where Is" And "With All Faults" Conveyance. Buyer acknowledges and agrees
that Buyer has had an opportunity to inspect the City Lot and is relying solely upon
Buyer's own inspection and other due diligence activities that Buyer may have
conducted in determining whether to acquire the City Lot, and not upon any information
provided by or on behalf of the City with respect thereto, including without limitation,
the Limited Review, the Review Documents and any summary thereof. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that the City Lot is being conveyed, and Buyer accepts the
City Lot, in its "As Is", "Where Is" and "With All Faults" condition without any covenant,
representation, or warranty, express or implied, of any kind, regarding the physical or
environmental condition of the City Lot or the suitability of the City Lot for any purpose
whatsoever. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer is solely responsible for any
investigation and remediation work necessary to put the City Lot in a condition which
is suitable for its intended use.

6. Release Of City. Buyer, on behalf of Buyer and Buyer's heirs, transferees, successors
and assigns, and anyone claiming by, through or under any of them, hereby releases,
relinquishes and forever discharges Granter and its officers, employees, agencies,
departments, officials, agents, representatives, contractors and consultants, from and
against any and all claims, demands, losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and court costs) based upon,
arising out of or in any way connected with, directly or indirectly, the environmental or
physical condition of the City Lot.

7. Affordable Housing And Municipal Code Requirements. Buyer acknowledges and
agrees that the sale of City-owned land may trigger Section 2-44-085 of the Municipal
Code of Chicago (currently and as hereafter amended, supplemented or replaced, the
"Affordable Requirements Ordinance"), and therefore, that a future residential project
on the City Lot may be subject to the requirements of the Affordable Requirements
Ordinance. Buyer also acknowledges and agrees that other provisions of the Municipal
Code of Chicago (currently and as hereafter amended, supplemented or replaced)
apply to the City Lot and Buyer's use, maintenance, and transfer of the City Lot.
SECTION 4. The Commissioner of the Department ("Commissioner"), or a designee of the Commissioner, is each hereby authorized, with the approval of the City's Corporation Counsel as to form and legality, to negotiate, execute and deliver such documents as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out and comply with the provisions of this ordinance, with such changes, deletions and insertions as shall be approved by the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee. Such documents may contain terms and provisions that the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee deems appropriate, including indemnification, releases, affidavits and other documents as may be reasonably necessary to remove exceptions from title with respect to the City Lot or otherwise may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to consummate the transaction contemplated hereby.

SECTION 5. If any provision of this ordinance shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect any of the other provisions of this ordinance.

SECTION 6. This ordinance shall take effect upon its passage and approval.

WHEREAS, ChiBlockBuilder allows prospective buyers to view a map of available properties and their associated land use categories online, and apply to purchase lots for targeted purposes; and

WHEREAS, The Department retained the services of CBRE Group, Inc. to provide market value assessments of the available City-owned properties based on comparable sales, and these market value assessments are posted on the ChiBlockBuilder website to establish purchase prices for all properties marketed for sale; and

WHEREAS, The Department offered the properties identified on Exhibit A attached hereto (the "City Lots") for sale on the ChiBlockBuilder website for community open space, with the goal of attracting residents, nonprofit organizations and businesses to fence and manage vacant property for local neighborhood activities; and

WHEREAS, The Department evaluated the applications from eligible open space buyers based on the following criteria: the detail and quality of the project description and site plan, the project budget, the impact on next door neighbors and the surrounding community, and proof of support for the project from neighbors, such as letters of support, presentations at community meetings, or consistency with neighborhood plans; and

WHEREAS, The Department selected the buyers for the City Lots identified on Exhibit A (each, a "Buyer") for the projects described on Exhibit A; and

WHEREAS, The names of all applicants for each City Lot, the names of the finalists and a summary of the finalist proposals are set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto; and

THE CITY OF CHICAGO, an Illinois municipal corporation and home rule unit of government, having its principal offices at 121 North LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois 60602 ("City" or "Grantor"), for and in consideration of $10,493.00, conveys and quitclaims all right, title and interest in the real property legally described and identified on Exhibit A attached hereto ("City Lot"), pursuant to an ordinance adopted by the City Council of the City ("City Council") on ______, and published in the Journal of the Proceedings of the City Council for such date at pages ___ through ___ to ___________ ("Buyer"), having a principal residence or business address at ____________, Chicago, Illinois 606__.

Without limiting the quitclaim nature of this deed, this conveyance is subject to: (a) the standard exceptions in an ALTA title insurance policy; (b) general real estate taxes and any special assessments or other taxes; (c) all easements, encroachments, covenants and restrictions of record and not shown of record; (d) such other title defects that may exist; and (e) any and all exceptions caused by the acts of Buyer or its agents.

In addition, this conveyance is subject to the following terms, covenants and conditions which are a part of the consideration for the City Lot and which shall run with the land and be
binding upon and enforceable against the Buyer and the Buyer's heirs, successors and assigns, in perpetuity (unless a shorter period is expressly stated below):

1. Covenant to Improve City Lot with 3-Unit Building; Restriction on Conveyance. Buyer shall (a) construct a three-unit residential building on the City Lot (the "Residential Building") in accordance with the site plan and elevations previously approved by the Department of Planning and Development ("Department") within eighteen (18) months of the date of this Deed; provided, however, the Department, in its sole discretion, may extend the completion date upon written request, (b) maintain the City Lot in accordance with the provisions of the Municipal Code of Chicago; and (c) not convey, assign, or otherwise transfer the City Lot until construction of the Residential Building is completed.

The forgoing covenants shall expire upon completion and occupancy of the Residential Building.

2. Environmental Documents Review. The City, acting through its Bureau of Environmental, Health and Safety Management in the Department of Assets, Information and Services ("Bureau"), has conducted a limited review ("Limited Review") of certain City records and other information ("Review Documents") in an effort to identify potential environmental concerns associated with the City Lot. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer has previously received a summary of the Bureau's Limited Review, and that the City has made all Review Documents available to Buyer for inspection and copying upon request.

Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the City is not obligated to locate all such documentation or information or to perform any environmental investigation or evaluation of the City Lot.

4. Historic Contamination of Urban Land. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that properties in urban areas, including Chicago, are frequently impacted by historical conditions and uses that may not be documented in the Review Documents, such as (a) buried demolition debris containing lead-based paint or asbestos, (b) underground heating oil tanks, (c) off-site
migration of chemicals from existing or former gas stations, dry cleaners, metal finishing operations, lumber treatment facilities, and other commercial, industrial or manufacturing land uses, (d) illegal dumping, (e) nearby railroad operations, and (f) airborne deposit of lead and other contaminants from historical use of lead gasoline and surrounding industries. Buyer acknowledges receipt of a fact sheet prepared by the United States Environmental Protection Agency about urban gardening best management practices to prevent or reduce exposure to contaminants that may be present in soils, “Reusing Potentially Contaminated Landscapes: Growing Gardens in Urban Soils,” EPA 542/F-10/011 (Spring 2011).

5. “As Is,” “Where Is” and “With All Faults” Conveyance. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer has had an opportunity to inspect the City Lot and is relying solely upon Buyer’s own inspection and other due diligence activities that Buyer may have conducted in determining whether to acquire the City Lot, and not upon any information provided by or on behalf of the City with respect thereto, including without limitation, the Limited Review, the Review Documents and any summary thereof. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the City Lot is being conveyed, and Buyer accepts the City Lot, in its “AS IS,” “WHERE IS” and “WITH ALL FAULTS” condition without any covenant, representation, or warranty, express or implied, of any kind, regarding the physical or environmental condition of the City Lot or the suitability of the City Lot for any purpose whatsoever. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer is solely responsible for any investigation and remediation work necessary to put the City Lot in a condition which is suitable for its intended use.

6. Release of City. Buyer, on behalf of Buyer and Buyer’s heirs, transferees, successors and assigns, and anyone claiming by, through or under any of them, hereby releases, relinquishes and forever discharges Grantor and its officers, employees, agencies, departments, officials, agents, representatives, contractors and consultants, from and against any and all claims, demands, losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs) based upon, arising out of or in any way connected with, directly or indirectly, the environmental or physical condition of the City Lot.

[02025-0014959]

The Committee on Housing and Real Estate submitted the following report:

CHICAGO, February 18, 2025.

To the President and Members of the City Council:

Your Committee on Housing and Real Estate, for which a meeting was held on February 11, 2025 and reconvened February 18, 2025, and to which was referred an ordinance introduced by the Department of Planning and Development for the sale of City-owned property at 2819 West Walnut Street to Shreya Singh under ChiBlockBuilder program for new residential, multi-family, three-unit building (27th Ward) (02025-0014959), having had the same under advisement, begs leave to report and recommend that Your Honorable Body Pass the said proposed ordinance transmitted herewith.

The recommendation was passed by the same roll call vote as was used to determine quorum in committee.

Sincerely,

(Signed) BYRON SIGCHO-LOPEZ,
Chair.

On motion of Alderperson Sigcho-Lopez, the said proposed ordinance transmitted with the foregoing committee report was Passed by yeas and nays as follows:

Yeas -- Alderpersons La Spata, Hopkins, Dowell, Robinson, Yancy, Hall, Mitchell, Harris, Beale, Chico, Lee, Ramirez, Quinn, Gutierrez, Lopez, Coleman, Moore, Curtis, O'Shea, Taylor, Mosley, Rodriguez, Tabares, Scott, Sigcho-Lopez, Fuentes, Burnett, Ervin, Taliaferro, Cruz, Cardona, Waguespack, Rodriguez-Sanchez, Conway, Ramirez-Rosa, Villegas, Mitts, Sposato, Nugent, Vasquez, Napolitano, Reilly, Knudsen, Lawson, Gardiner, Clay, Martin, Manaa-Hoppenworth, Hadden, Silverstein -- 50.

Alderperson Harris moved to reconsider the foregoing vote. The motion was lost.
The following is said ordinance as passed:

WHEREAS, The City of Chicago ("City") is a home rule unit of government by virtue of the provisions of the Constitution of the State of Illinois of 1970 and, as such, may exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and

WHEREAS, The City, through the foreclosure of demolition liens, tax sales and other methods of acquisition, has acquired title to thousands of parcels of vacant land which are costly to clean up and maintain, do not generate property taxes and are a detriment to the community; and

WHEREAS, The City has traditionally sold much of its land directly to purchasers after receiving property inquiries, a method which is inefficient, labor-intensive and also lacks transparency; and

WHEREAS, In an effort to attract and reach potential buyers and create a more competitive process, the Department of Planning and Development (the "Department") created chiblockbuilder.com ("ChiBlockBuilder"), a website-based platform for selling vacant City-owned property with predetermined purchase prices and online application materials; and

WHEREAS, City lots sold through ChiBlockBuilder are offered for sale in different categories of use, such as affordable housing, market rate sales, missing middle-density housing, neighborhood side yards, community open space, and urban agriculture; and

WHEREAS, ChiBlockBuilder allows prospective buyers to view a map of available properties and their associated land use categories online, and apply to purchase lots for targeted purposes; and

WHEREAS, The Department retained the services of CBRE Group, Inc. ("CBRE") to provide market value assessments of the available City-owned properties based on comparable sales, and these market value assessments are posted on the ChiBlockBuilder website to establish purchase prices for all properties marketed for sale; and

WHEREAS, The Department offered the property commonly known as 2819 West Walnut Street, Chicago, Illinois, and legally described on Exhibit A attached hereto (the "City Lot"), along with many other City-owned lots, for sale on the ChiBlockBuilder website in five categories: affordable housing, side yards, open space, market rate housing and commercial development; and

WHEREAS, The Department accepted applications for the City Lot beginning on November 17, 2022 and ending on February 3, 2023 (the "Application Period"); and
WHEREAS, A public notice directing prospective applicants to ChiBlockBuilder for listings of City-owned properties for sale during the Application Period was published in the Chicago Tribune on January 20 and 27 and February 3, 2023; and

WHEREAS, The Department selected 2819 Walnut LLC, an Illinois limited liability company ("Buyer") for the sale of the City Lot for the market-rate housing project described on Exhibit A (the "Project"); and

WHEREAS, The names of all other applicants for the City Lot, and a summary of each of their proposals, are set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto; and

WHEREAS, Eligible buyers of City-owned land through ChiBlockBuilder for market-rate housing during the Application Period had to meet the following qualifications: (1) be individuals, nonprofit organizations or businesses registered in Illinois; (2) submit a site plan, budget and program for the project; (3) conform to Neighborhood Design Guidelines; (4) show support from the nearby community for the project; (5) provide an analysis of the impact of the project on the immediate area and surrounding community; (6) be able to pay property taxes on the City Lot and have no outstanding debt with the City; (7) be able to conform with current zoning requirements or secure required zoning approvals and permits; and (8) be able to maintain the City Lot as proposed in the application materials; and

WHEREAS, The Department desires to convey the City Lot to the Buyer subject to a deed restriction requiring the Buyer to construct the Project; and

WHEREAS, The market value assessment of the City Lot, as of June 17, 2024, as determined by CBRE is $12,953; and

WHEREAS, The Buyer has offered to purchase, and the City has agreed to sell, the City Lot to the Buyer for $15,000 ("Purchase Price"); now, therefore,

Be It Ordained by the City Council of the City of Chicago:

SECTION 1. The foregoing recitals, findings and statements of fact are incorporated herein and made a material part of this ordinance.

SECTION 2. The City Council hereby approves the sale of the City Lot in its "as is" condition to the Buyer for the Purchase Price, subject to the Buyer's satisfaction of each of the following conditions precedent to closing (unless waived by the Department in its sole discretion):

a) Buyer must submit to the Department, and the Department must approve, the final construction plans and specifications for the Project; and

b) Buyer must obtain all building permits and other required permits and approvals, including zoning approvals if applicable, necessary to construct such Project and submit evidence thereof to the Department.
If Buyer fails to close on the acquisition of the City Lot within six (6) months of the date of passage and approval of this ordinance, then this ordinance will be rendered null and void and of no further effect, unless the Commissioner of the Department ("Commissioner"), in the Commissioner's sole discretion, upon a request from Buyer, extends the closing date. Buyer shall pay all escrow fees and other title insurance fees and closing costs.

SECTION 3. The Mayor or the Mayor's proxy is authorized to execute, and the City Clerk or the Deputy City Clerk is authorized to attest, a quitclaim deed ("Deed") conveying the City Lot to the Buyer, or to a land trust of which the Buyer is the sole beneficiary, or to an entity of which the Buyer is the sole controlling party or which is comprised of the same principal parties. The Deed shall be in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit C.

SECTION 4. The Commissioner, or a designee of the Commissioner, is each hereby authorized, with the approval of the City's Corporation Counsel as to form and legality, to negotiate, execute and deliver such documents as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out and comply with the provisions of this ordinance, with such changes, deletions and insertions as shall be approved by the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee. Such documents may contain terms and provisions that the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee deems appropriate, including indemnification, releases, affidavits and other documents as may be reasonably necessary to remove exceptions from title with respect to the City Lot or otherwise may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to consummate the transaction contemplated hereby.

SECTION 5. If any provision of this ordinance shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect any of the other provisions of this ordinance.

SECTION 6. This ordinance shall take effect upon its passage and approval.

Exhibits "A", "B" and "C" referred to in this ordinance read as follows:

WHEREAS, The Department accepted applications for the City Lots beginning on April 1, 2024 and ending on May 16, 2024 (the "Application Period"); and
WHEREAS, A public notice directing prospective applicants to ChiBlockBuilder for listings of City-owned properties for sale during the Application Period was published in the Chicago Tribune on April 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 and May 6 and 13, 2024; and

WHEREAS, The Department reviewed the eligibility of ChiBlockBuilder urban agriculture applicants and reviewed their applications based on the following criteria: (i) priority given to projects with evidence of clear commitment and financial and technical support to maintain site, including funding, partnerships with other organizations and clear plans for identifying further funding; (ii) priority given to projects with clear plans and designs and realistic timeline, and that are ready to start activating the land in 2025; (iii) project proposal plan and design have measurable and achievable goals to grow food; (iv) priority given to projects that have support from neighbors, alderpersons, other growers or organizations as indicated through letters of support and clear plans to engage the community they want to grow in; (v) priority given to projects that will provide/sell food for the community they grow in; (vi) priority given to applicants residing in Chicago with connections to the neighborhood they are applying in; (vii) priority given to applicants from communities disproportionately impacted by food insecurity; (viii) priority given to projects where the applicant has previous experience with urban agriculture and similar projects; and

WHEREAS, The Department selected the buyers for the City Lots identified on Exhibit A (each, a “Buyer”) for the projects described on Exhibit A; and

WHEREAS, The names of all applicants for each City Lot, the names of the finalists, and a summary of the finalist proposals are set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto; and

QUITCLAIM DEED
(Vacant Land)

THIS TRANSFER IS EXEMPT UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE ILLINOIS REAL ESTATE TRANSFER TAX ACT, 35 ILCS 200/31-45(b); COOK COUNTY ORDINANCE NO. 93-0-27(B); AND THE CHICAGO REAL PROPERTY TRANSFER TAX, MUNICIPAL CODE SECTION 3-33-060(B).

THE CITY OF CHICAGO, an Illinois municipal corporation and home rule unit of government, having its principal offices at 121 North LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois 60602 ("City" or "Grantor"), for and in consideration of $_.00, conveys and quitclaims all right, title and interest in the real property legally described and identified under City Lot _ on Exhibit A attached hereto ("Property"), pursuant to an ordinance adopted by the City Council of the City ("City Council") on ____, 2025, and published in the Journal of the Proceedings of the City Council for such date at pages __ through ___, to [Buyer], an Illinois not for profit corporation ("Grantee"), having its principal office at [Address].

Without limiting the quitclaim nature of this deed, this conveyance is subject to: (a) the standard exceptions in an ALTA title insurance policy; (b) general real estate taxes and any special assessments or other taxes; (c) all easements, encroachments, covenants and restrictions of record and not shown of record; (d) such other title defects that may exist; and (e) any and all exceptions caused by the acts of Grantee or its agents.

In addition, this conveyance is subject to the following terms, covenants and conditions which are a part of the consideration for the Property and which shall run with the land and be binding upon and enforceable against the Grantee and the Grantee's heirs, successors, and assigns, in perpetuity (unless a shorter period is expressly stated below):
1. **Covenant to Operate Urban Agriculture Project; Transfer Prohibition.** Grantee shall improve the Property with the urban agriculture project described in Grantee's ChiBlockBuilder application and approved by the City's Department of Planning and Development ("DPD"). The urban growing operations must be fully operational within five (5) years from the date of this Deed (the "Development Period"). "Fully operational" means the land must be producing food for sale or donation to communities experiencing a lack of access to healthy foods. Grantee must submit proof of compliance with this covenant annually to the City's Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection ("BACP") during the Development Period, and thereafter the project must remain fully operational until the 10th anniversary of the date of this Deed (the "Compliance Period"). Grantee must maintain the project during the Compliance Period, including soil beds, fencing, and hoop houses, and must comply with the City's urban agriculture requirements. During the Compliance Period, Grantee may not, without the prior written consent of DPD, which consent shall be in DPD's sole discretion, directly or indirectly sell, transfer, convey, lease or otherwise dispose of the Property or any interest therein. If Grantee fails to comply with any of the foregoing conditions, the City may record a notice of default against the Property and shall have the right to exercise any and all remedies available to it at law or in equity, including the right to re-enter the Property and revest title in the City. Grantee, at the request of the City, covenants to execute and deliver to the City a reconveyance deed to the Property to further evidence such revesting of title. This right of reverter in favor of the City shall terminate ten (10) years following the date of this Deed.

2. **Environmental Documents Review.** The City, acting through its Bureau of Environmental, Health and Safety Management in the Department of Assets, Information and Services ("Bureau"), has conducted a limited review ("Limited Review") of certain City records and other information ("Review Documents") in an effort to identify potential environmental concerns associated with the Property. Grantee acknowledges and agrees that Grantee has previously received a summary of the Bureau's Limited Review, and that the City has made all Review Documents available to Grantee for inspection and copying upon request.

3. **Limited Nature of City's Limited Review.** Grantee acknowledges and agrees that the City does not represent or warrant that the Bureau's methodology for or findings from its Limited Review are accurate or complete or that the environmental condition of or risks to the Property are consistent with the Bureau's summary of its Limited Review. Grantee acknowledges and agrees that the City did not perform a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment or conduct a thorough environmental investigation of the Property, and that the City's review of the Review Documents was limited. Grantee acknowledges and agrees that the Bureau's Limited Review may not have located all City, publicly available, or other documents or information relating to the condition of the Property, and that there may be other conditions, uses, and sources or types of contamination affecting the Property. Grantee acknowledges and agrees that the City is not obligated to locate all such documentation or information or to perform any environmental investigation or evaluation of the Property.
4. **Historic Contamination of Urban Land.** Grantee acknowledges and agrees that properties in urban areas, including Chicago, are frequently impacted by historical conditions and uses that may not be documented in the Review Documents, such as (a) buried demolition debris containing lead-based paint or asbestos, (b) underground heating oil tanks, (c) off-site migration of chemicals from existing or former gas stations, dry cleaners, metal finishing operations, lumber treatment facilities, and other commercial, industrial or manufacturing land uses, (d) illegal dumping, (e) nearby railroad operations, and (f) airborne deposit of lead and other contaminants from historical use of lead gasoline and surrounding industries. Grantee acknowledges receipt of a fact sheet prepared by the United States Environmental Protection Agency about urban gardening best management practices to prevent or reduce exposure to contaminants that may be present in soils, "Reusing Potentially Contaminated Landscapes: Growing Gardens in Urban Soils," EPA 542/F-10/011 (Spring 2011).

5. **"As Is," "Where Is" and "With All Faults" Conveyance.** Grantee acknowledges and agrees that Grantee has had an opportunity to inspect the Property and is relying solely upon Grantee's own inspection and other due diligence activities that Grantee may have conducted in determining whether to acquire the Property, and not upon any information provided by or on behalf of the City with respect thereto, including without limitation, the Limited Review, the Review Documents and any summary thereof. Grantee acknowledges and agrees that the Property is being conveyed, and Grantee accepts the Property Lots, in its "AS IS," "WHERE IS" and "WITH ALL FAULTS" condition without any covenant, representation, or warranty, express or implied, of any kind, regarding the physical or environmental condition of the Property or the suitability of the Property for any purpose whatsoever. Grantee acknowledges and agrees that Grantee is solely responsible for any investigation and remediation work necessary to put the Property in a condition which is suitable for its intended use.

6. **Release of City.** Grantee, on behalf of Grantee and Grantee's heirs, transferees, successors and assigns, and anyone claiming by, through or under any of them, hereby releases, relinquishes and forever discharges Granter and its officers, employees, agencies, departments, officials, agents, representatives, contractors and consultants, from and against any and all claims, demands, losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and court costs) based upon, arising out of or in any way connected with, directly or indirectly, the environmental or physical condition of the Property.

7. **Affordable Housing and Municipal Code Requirements.** Grantee acknowledges and agrees that the sale of City-owned land may trigger Section 2-44-085 of the Municipal Code of Chicago (currently and as hereafter amended, supplemented or replaced, the "Affordable Requirements Ordinance"), and therefore, that a future residential project on the Property may be subject to the requirements of the Affordable Requirements Ordinance. Grantee also acknowledges and agrees that other provisions of the Municipal Code of Chicago (currently and as hereafter amended, supplemented or replaced) apply to the Property and Grantee's use, maintenance, and transfer of the Property.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Grantor has caused this instrument to be duly executed in its name and on its behalf and its seal to be hereunto affixed, by its Mayor and City Clerk, on or as of ____________, 2025.

Without limiting the quitclaim nature of this deed, this conveyance is subject to: (a) the standard exceptions in an ALTA title insurance policy; (b) general real estate taxes and any special assessments or other taxes; (c) all easements, encroachments, covenants and restrictions of record and not shown of record; (d) such other title defects that may exist; and (e) any and all exceptions caused by the acts of Buyer or its agents.
In addition, this conveyance is subject to the following terms, covenants and conditions which are a part of the consideration for the City Lot and which shall run with the land and be binding upon and enforceable against the Buyer and the Buyer’s heirs, successors and assigns, in perpetuity (unless a shorter period is expressly stated below):

1. Covenant to Improve City Lot with a residential multi-family, 3-unit building; Restriction on Conveyance. Buyer shall (a) construct a residential multi-family, 3-unit building on the City Lot (the “Project”) in accordance with the site plan and elevations previously approved by the Department of Planning and Development (“Department”) within eighteen (18) months of the date of this Deed; provided, however, the Department, in its sole discretion, may extend the completion date upon written request, (b) maintain the City Lot in accordance with the provisions of the Municipal Code of Chicago; and (c) not convey, assign, or otherwise transfer the City Lot until construction of the Project is completed. If any of these conditions are not met, the City may record a notice of default against the City Lot and shall have the right to exercise any and all remedies available to it at law or in equity, including the right to re-enter and take possession of the City Lot, terminate the estate conveyed to the Buyer, and revest title to the City Lot in the City. Buyer, at the request of the City, covenants to execute and deliver to the City a reconveyance deed to the City Lot to further evidence such revesting of title. The forgoing covenants shall expire upon completion and occupancy of the Project.

2. Environmental Documents Review. The City, acting through its Bureau of Environmental, Health and Safety Management in the Department of Assets, Information and Services (“Bureau”), has conducted a limited review (“Limited Review”) of certain City records and other information (“Review Documents”) in an effort to identify potential environmental concerns associated with the City Lot. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer has previously received a summary of the Bureau’s Limited Review, and that the City has made all Review Documents available to Buyer for inspection and copying upon request.

3. Limited Nature of City’s Review. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the City does not represent or warrant that the Bureau’s methodology for or findings from its Limited Review are accurate or complete or that the environmental condition of or risks to the City Lot are consistent with the Bureau’s summary of its Limited Review. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the City did not perform a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment or conduct a thorough environmental investigation of the City Lot, and that the City’s review of the Review Documents was limited. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Bureau’s Limited Review may not have located all City, publicly available, or other documents or information relating to the condition of the City Lot, and that there may be other conditions, uses, and sources or types of contamination affecting the City Lot. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the City is not obligated to locate all such documentation or information or to perform any environmental investigation or evaluation of the City Lot.

4. Historic Contamination of Urban Land. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that properties in urban areas, including Chicago, are frequently impacted by historical conditions and uses
that may not be documented in the Review Documents, such as (a) buried demolition debris containing lead-based paint or asbestos, (b) underground heating oil tanks, (c) off-site migration of chemicals from existing or former gas stations, dry cleaners, metal finishing operations, lumber treatment facilities, and other commercial, industrial or manufacturing land uses, (d) illegal dumping, (e) nearby railroad operations, and (f) airborne deposit of lead and other contaminants from historical use of lead gasoline and surrounding industries. Buyer acknowledges receipt of a fact sheet prepared by the United States Environmental Protection Agency about urban gardening best management practices to prevent or reduce exposure to contaminants that may be present in soils, “Reusing Potentially Contaminated Landscapes: Growing Gardens in Urban Soils,” EPA 542/F-10/011 (Spring 2011).

5. “As Is,” “Where Is” and “With All Faults” Conveyance. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer has had an opportunity to inspect the City Lot and is relying solely upon Buyer’s own inspection and other due diligence activities that Buyer may have conducted in determining whether to acquire the City Lot, and not upon any information provided by or on behalf of the City with respect thereto, including without limitation, the Limited Review, the Review Documents and any summary thereof. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the City Lot is being conveyed, and Buyer accepts the City Lot, in its “AS IS,” “WHERE IS” and “WITH ALL FAULTS” condition without any covenant, representation, or warranty, express or implied, of any kind, regarding the physical or environmental condition of the City Lot or the suitability of the City Lot for any purpose whatsoever. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer is solely responsible for any investigation and remediation work necessary to put the City Lot in a condition which is suitable for its intended use.

6. Release of City. Buyer, on behalf of Buyer and Buyer’s heirs, transferees, successors and assigns, and anyone claiming by, through or under any of them, hereby releases, relinquishes and forever discharges Grantor and its officers, employees, agencies, departments, officials, agents, representatives, contractors and consultants, from and against any and all claims, demands, losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs) based upon, arising out of or in any way connected with, directly or indirectly, the environmental or physical condition of the City Lot.

scheme, painting, nature, type, content and design of all barricades. The Developer shall erect all signs and barricades so as not to interfere with or affect any bus stop or train station in the vicinity of the Property.

11.5 Survival. The provisions of this Section 11 shall survive the Closing.

SECTION 12. LIMITED APPLICABILITY.

Any approval given by DPD pursuant to this Agreement is for the purpose of this Agreement only and does not constitute the approval required by the City's Department of Buildings or any other City department, nor does such approval constitute an approval of the quality, structural soundness or safety of any improvements located or to be located on the Property, or the compliance of said improvements with any Laws, private covenants, restrictions of record, or any agreement affecting the Property or any part thereof.

SECTION 13. COMMENCEMENT AND COMPLETION OF PROJECT.

The Developer shall commence construction of the Project no later than 30 days after the Closing, and shall complete the Project (as evidenced by the issuance of the Certificate of Completion) no later than eighteen (18) months after the Closing; provided, however, DPD, in its sole discretion, may extend the construction commencement and completion dates. The Developer shall give written notice to the City within five (5) days after it commences construction. The Developer shall construct the Project in accordance with this Agreement, the Final Plans, the Budget, and all applicable Laws and covenants and restrictions of record.

SECTION 14. CERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION.

14.1 Upon satisfaction of the requirements set forth in this Section 14 for the Project, and upon the Developer's written request, DPD shall issue to the Developer a certificate of completion for the Project ("Certificate of Completion") in recordable form certifying that the Developer has fulfilled its obligation to complete the Project in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Developer's written request shall include a copy of the recorded Final Comprehensive Residential NFR Letter for the Property pursuant to Section 22 hereof.

14.2 Within forty-five (45) days after receipt of a written request by the Developer for a Certificate of Completion, the City shall provide the Developer with either the Certificate of Completion or a written statement indicating in adequate detail how the Developer has failed to complete the Project in compliance with this Agreement, or is otherwise in default, and what measures or acts are necessary, in the sole opinion of the City, for the Developer to take or perform in order to obtain the Certificate of Completion. If the City requires additional measures or acts to assure compliance, the Developer shall resubmit a written request for the Certificate of Completion upon compliance with the City's response. The Certificate of Completion shall be in recordable form, and shall, upon recording, constitute a conclusive determination of satisfaction and termination of the covenants in this Agreement and the Deed with respect to the Developer's obligations to construct the Project. The Certificate of Completion shall not, however, constitute evidence that the Developer has complied with any Laws relating to the construction of the Project, and shall not serve as any "guaranty" as to the quality of the construction. Nor shall the Certificate of Completion release the Developer from its obligation to comply with any on-going covenants as referenced in Section 19.
14.3 The Reconveyance Deed shall be returned to the Developer after the issuance of the Certificate of Completion.

SECTION 15. RESTRICTIONS ON USE.

The Developer, for itself and its successors and assigns, covenants and agrees as follows:

15.1 Non-Discrimination. The Developer shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, sex, gender identity, age, religion, disability, national origin, ancestry, sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, military discharge status, or source of income in the sale, lease, rental, use or occupancy of the Property or the Project or any part thereof.

The Developer, for itself and its successors and assigns, acknowledges and agrees that the development and use restrictions set forth in this Section 15 constitute material, bargained-for consideration for the City and are intended to further the City's public policies.

SECTION 16. PROHIBITION AGAINST SALE OR TRANSFER OF PROPERTY.

Prior to the issuance of the Certificate of Completion for the Project, the Developer may not, without the prior written consent of DPD, which consent shall be in DPD's sole and absolute discretion: (a) directly or indirectly sell, transfer, convey, or otherwise dispose of all or any portion of the Property or the Project or any interest therein to any person or entity that is not an Affiliate of the Developer; or (b) directly or indirectly assign this Agreement (other than to a lender for collateral assignment purposes as permitted under Section 17). The Developer acknowledges and agrees that DPD may withhold its consent under (a) or (b) above if, among other reasons, the proposed purchaser, transferee or assignee (or such entity's principal officers or directors) is in violation of any Laws, or if the Developer fails to submit sufficient evidence of the financial responsibility, business background and reputation of the proposed purchaser, transferee or assignee. If the Developer is a business entity, no principal party of the Developer (e.g., a general partner, member, manager or shareholder) may sell, transfer or assign any of its interest in the entity prior to the issuance of the Certificate of Completion to anyone other than another principal party, without the prior written consent of DPD, which consent shall be in DPD's sole discretion. The Developer must disclose the identity of all limited partners to the City at the time such limited partners obtain an interest in the Developer.

SECTION 17. MORTGAGES AND OTHER LIENS.

17.1 Limitation upon Encumbrance of Property. Prior to the issuance of the Certificate of Completion for the Project, the Developer may not, without the prior written consent of DPD, which consent shall be in DPD's sole discretion, engage in any financing or other transaction which would create an encumbrance or lien on the Property, except for the Lender Financing, if any, approved pursuant to Section 9, which shall be limited to funds necessary to construct the Project.

17.2 Mortgagees Not Obligated to Construct. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or of the Deed, the holder of any mortgage authorized by this Agreement (or any affiliate of such holder) shall not itself be obligated to construct or complete the Project, or to guarantee such construction or completion, but shall be bound by the other covenants running with the land specified in Section 18 and, at the Closing, shall execute a subordination agreement in accordance with Section 10.3. If any such mortgagee or its affiliate succeeds to the Developer's interest in the Property (or any portion thereof) prior to the issuance of the Certificate of
Completion, whether by foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or otherwise, and thereafter transfers its interest in the Property (or any portion thereof) to another party, such transferee shall be obligated to complete the Project, and shall also be bound by the other covenants running with the land specified in Section 18.

SECTION 18. COVENANTS RUNNING WITH THE LAND.

The Parties agree, and the Deed shall so expressly provide, that the covenants, agreements, releases and other terms and provisions contained in Section 13 (Commencement and Completion of Project), Section 15 (Restrictions on Use), Section 16 (Prohibition Against Sale or Transfer of Property), Section 17.1 (Limitation Upon Encumbrance of Property), and Section 22.5 (Environmental Release), touch and concern and shall be appurtenant to and shall run with the Property. Such covenants, agreements, releases and other terms and provisions shall be binding on the Developer and its respective successors and assigns (subject to the limitation set forth in Section 17 above as to any permitted mortgagee) to the fullest extent permitted by law and equity for the benefit and in favor of the City and shall be enforceable by the City. Such covenants, agreements, releases and other terms and provisions shall terminate as follows:

| SECTION | COVENANT                        | TERMINATION                      |
|---------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| §13     | Completion of Project           | Upon issuance of Certificate of Completion |
| §15.1   | Non-Discrimination              | No limitation as to time         |
| §16     | Sale/Transfer Prohibition       | Upon issuance of Certificate of Completion |
| §17     | Limitation on Encumbrances      | Upon issuance of Certificate of Completion |
| §22.5   | Environmental Release           | No limitation as to time         |

SECTION 19. PERFORMANCE AND BREACH.

19.1 Time of the Essence. Time is of the essence in the Developer's performance of its obligations under this Agreement.

19.2 Event of Default. The occurrence of any one or more of the following events or occurrences shall constitute an "Event of Default" under this Agreement:

(a) the failure of the Developer to perform, keep or observe any of the covenants, conditions, promises, agreements or obligations of the Developer under this Agreement or any grant agreement or other agreement between the City and the Developer;

(b) the making or furnishing by the Developer of any warranty, representation, statement, certification, schedule or report to the City (whether in this Agreement, an Economic Disclosure Statement, or another document) which is untrue or misleading in any material respect;

(c) except as otherwise permitted hereunder, the creation (whether voluntary or involuntary) of, or any attempt to create, any lien or other encumbrance upon the
Property or the Project, or the making or any attempt to make any levy, seizure or attachment thereof;

(d) the commencement of any proceedings in bankruptcy by or against the Developer or the liquidation or reorganization of the Developer, or alleging that the Developer is insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they mature, or for the readjustment or arrangement of the Developer's debts, whether under the United States Bankruptcy Code or under any other state or federal law, now or hereafter existing, for the relief of debtors, or the commencement of any analogous statutory or non-statutory proceedings involving the Developer; provided, however, that if such commencement of proceedings is involuntary, such action shall not constitute an Event of Default unless such proceedings are not dismissed within sixty (60) days after the commencement of such proceedings;

(e) the appointment of a receiver or trustee for the Developer, for any substantial part of the Developer's assets or the institution of any proceedings for the dissolution, or the full or partial liquidation, or the merger or consolidation, of the Developer; provided, however, that if such appointment or commencement of proceedings is involuntary, such action shall not constitute an Event of Default unless such appointment is not revoked or such proceedings are not dismissed within sixty (60) days after the commencement thereof;

(f) the entry of any judgment or order against the Developer which is related to the Property and remains unsatisfied or undischarged and in effect for sixty (60) days after such entry without a stay of enforcement or execution;

(g) the occurrence of an event of default under the Lender Financing, which default is not cured within any applicable cure period; and

(h) the dissolution of the Developer.

19.3 Cure. If the Developer defaults in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the Developer shall have thirty (30) days after written notice of default from the City to cure the default, or such longer period as shall be reasonably necessary to cure such default, provided the Developer promptly commences such cure and thereafter diligently pursues such cure to completion (so long as continuation of the default does not create material risk of damage to the improvements comprising the Project or injury to persons using the Project). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, there shall be no notice requirement or cure period with respect to Events of Default described in Section 16 (Prohibition Against Transfer of Property).

19.4 Default Prior to Issuance of Certificate of Completion. If an Event of Default occurs prior to the issuance of the Certificate of Completion, and the default is not cured in the time period provided for in Section 19.3 above, the City may terminate this Agreement and pursue and secure any available remedy against the Developer in any court of competent jurisdiction by any action or proceeding at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, damages, injunctive relief, the specific performance of the agreements contained herein, and the right to revest title to the Property in the City pursuant to the Reconveyance Deed; provided, however, that the recording of the Reconveyance Deed shall not defeat, render invalid, or limit in any way, the lien of any mortgage authorized by this Agreement. If the Reconveyance Deed is recorded by the City, the Developer shall be responsible for all real estate taxes and assessments which accrued during the period the Property was owned by the Developer, and the Developer shall cause the release
of all unpermitted liens or encumbrances placed on the Property during the period of time the Property was owned by the Developer. The Developer will cooperate with the City to ensure that if the City records the Reconveyance Deed, such recording is effective for purposes of transferring title to the Property to the City.

19.5 Resale of the Property. Upon the reconveyance of the Property to the City as provided in Section 19.4, the City may complete the Project at its own cost (if the Project has not been completed) or convey the Property to a qualified and financially responsible party reasonably acceptable to the first mortgagee (if any), who (at its own cost) shall assume the obligation of completing the Project or such other improvements as shall be satisfactory to DPD (if the Project has not been completed), and otherwise comply with the covenants that run with the land as specified in Section 18.

19.6 Disposition of Resale Proceeds. If the City sells the Property as provided for in Section 19.5, the net proceeds from the sale, after payment of all amounts owed under any mortgage liens authorized by this Agreement in order of lien priority, shall be utilized to reimburse the City for:

(a) the dollar amount by which the City wrote-down the value of the Property when the City conveyed the Property to the Developer, if any; and

(b) costs and expenses incurred by the City (including, without limitation, salaries of personnel) in connection with the recapture, management and resale of the Property (less any income derived by the City from the Property in connection with such management); and

(c) all costs to remediate the Property; and

(d) all unpaid taxes, assessments, and water and sewer charges assessed against the Property; and

(e) any payments made (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs) to discharge or prevent from attaching or being made any subsequent encumbrances or liens due to obligations, defaults or acts of the Developer; and

(f) any expenditures made or obligations incurred with respect to construction or maintenance of the Project; and

(g) any other amounts owed to the City by the Developer.

The Developer shall be entitled to receive any remaining proceeds.

SECTION 20. CONFLICT OF INTEREST; CITY'S REPRESENTATIVES NOT INDIVIDUALLY LIABLE.

The Developer represents and warrants that no agent, official or employee of the City shall have any personal interest, direct or indirect, in the Developer, this Agreement, the Property or the Project, nor shall any such agent, official or employee participate in any decision relating to this Agreement which affects his or her personal interests or the interests of any corporation, partnership, association or other entity in which he or she is directly or indirectly interested. No
agent, official, director, officer, trustee or employee of the City or the Developer shall be personally liable in the event of any default under or breach of this Agreement or for any amount which may become due with respect to any commitment or obligation under the terms of this Agreement.

SECTION 21. INDEMNIFICATION.

The Developer agrees to indemnify, pay, defend and hold the City, and its elected and appointed officials, employees and agents (individually, an "Indemnitee," and collectively the "Indemnitees") harmless from and against any and all Losses in connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding commenced or threatened, whether or not such Indemnitees shall be designated a party thereto, that may be imposed upon, suffered, incurred by or asserted against the Indemnitees in any manner relating to or arising out of: (a) the failure of the Developer to comply with any of the terms, covenants and conditions applicable to the Developer and contained within this Agreement; (b) the failure of the Developer or any Agent of the Developer to pay contractors, subcontractors or material suppliers in connection with the construction and management of the Project; (c) any misrepresentation or omission made by the Developer or any Agent in connection with this Agreement; (d) the failure of the Developer to redress any misrepresentation or omission in this Agreement or any other document relating hereto; and (e) any activity undertaken by the Developer or any Agent or Affiliate of the Developer on the Property prior to or after the Closing. This indemnification shall survive the Closing and any termination of this Agreement (regardless of the reason for such termination).

SECTION 22. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

22.1 "AS IS" SALE. THE DEVELOPER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS HAD AN ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY TO INSPECT THE PROPERTY AND EVALUATE THE STRUCTURAL, PHYSICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND RISKS OF THE PROPERTY AND ACCEPTS THE RISK THAT ANY INSPECTION MAY NOT DISCLOSE ALL MATERIAL MATTERS AFFECTING THE PROPERTY (AND ANY IMPROVEMENTS THEREON). THE DEVELOPER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS RELYING SOLELY UPON ITS OWN INSPECTION AND OTHER DUE DILIGENCE ACTIVITIES IN DECIDING WHETHER TO ACQUIRE THE PROPERTY, AND NOT UPON ANY INFORMATION (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES OR REPORTS OF ANY KIND) PROVIDED BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OR ITS AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES WITH RESPECT THERETO. THE DEVELOPER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE PROPERTY IS BEING CONVEYED, AND THE DEVELOPER AGREES TO ACCEPT THE PROPERTY, IN ITS "AS IS," "WHERE IS" AND "WITH ALL FAULTS" CONDITION AT CLOSING, WITHOUT ANY COVENANT, REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF ANY KIND, AS TO THE STRUCTURAL, PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY (OR ANY IMPROVEMENTS THEREON), ITS COMPLIANCE WITH ANY LAWS, OR THE SUITABILITY OR MERCHANTABILITY OF THE PROPERTY FOR ANY PURPOSE WHATSOEVER. THE DEVELOPER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT IT IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INVESTIGATION AND REMEDIATION WORK NECESSARY TO PUT THE PROPERTY IN A CONDITION WHICH IS SUITABLE FOR ITS INTENDED USE.

22.2 Environmental Remediation. The Developer has obtained a Phase I ESA of the Property dated ___, and a follow-up Phase II ESA dated ___. The Phase II ESA disclosed the presence of contamination exceeding residential remediation objectives as set forth in 35 Ill. Adm. Code Part 742, and the Developer has agreed to enroll the Property (or the applicable portion thereof) in the SRP and take all necessary and proper steps to obtain written approval from the IEPA of a Remedial Action Plan ("RAP Approval Letter"). The Developer
acknowledges and agrees that it may not commence construction on the Property until the IEPA issues the RAP Approval Letter for the Property. Upon receipt of the RAP Approval Letter, the Developer covenants and agrees to complete all Remediation Work necessary to obtain a Final Comprehensive Residential NFR Letter for the Property using all reasonable means. 2FM shall have the right to review in advance and approve all documents submitted to the IEPA under the SRP, as amended or supplemented from time to time, including, without limitation, the SRP Documents and any changes thereto, and the Developer's estimate of the cost to perform the Remediation Work. The Developer shall cooperate and consult with the City at all relevant times (and in all cases upon the City's request) with respect to environmental matters. The Developer shall bear sole responsibility for all costs of the Remediation Work necessary to obtain the Final Comprehensive Residential NFR Letter, and any other investigative and cleanup costs associated with the Property, including, but not limited to, the removal of pre-existing building foundations, demolition debris, and soil or soil gas not meeting the requirements of 35 Ill. Adm. Code 742.305. In addition, the Developer shall remove and close any identified underground storage tanks ("USTs") in accordance with applicable regulations, including 41 Ill. Adm. Code Part 175, and shall properly address any identified leaking USTs in accordance with 35 Ill. Adm. Code Part 734. The Developer shall promptly transmit to 2FM copies of all Environmental Documents prepared or received with respect to the Remediation Work, including, without limitation, any written communications delivered to or received from the IEPA or other regulatory agencies. The Developer acknowledges and agrees that the City will not issue a Certificate of Completion of the Project, and the Developer may not request a certificate of occupancy from the Department of Buildings, until the IEPA has issued, 2FM has approved (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld), and the Developer has recorded a Final Comprehensive Residential NFR Letter for the Property with the Cook County Clerk's Office. If the Developer fails to obtain the Final Comprehensive Residential NFR Letter within six (6) months after the submission of the Remedial Action Completion Report to the IEPA, unless the City agreed to extend such time period, then the City shall have the right to record a notice of default of this RDA against the Property.

22.3 Hazardous Building Material Survey. The Developer shall perform a Hazardous Building Material Survey and submit a report documenting the results of the survey to 2FM prior to performing any renovation, demolition, or abatement work on the Building. As used herein, a "Hazardous Building Material Survey" means a survey that identifies the presence and location of hazardous materials in a building including (but not limited to) asbestos, lead-based paint, polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-containing equipment and materials (such as lighting ballasts, switchgears, transformers, and hydraulic fluids), mercury-containing equipment and materials (such as mercury lamps, thermostats, switches, thermometers, regulators, and gauges), radioactive containing equipment and/or waste, medical wastes (such as biological or infectious wastes, hazardous chemicals, and/or wastes), refrigerants such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), large appliances or equipment, mold, or any other materials that may require special handling or disposal during or after demolition. The Hazardous Building Material Survey must document the type, location, quantity, and condition of each hazardous material that is identified. The Developer shall submit an abatement plan to 2FM for its review and approval and shall incorporate the abatement requirements into the Final Plans. The Developer shall thereafter abate any hazardous materials in or on the Building that may be impacted by renovation or demolition activities, or are in poor or unstable condition, in accordance with the approved plans. Prior to occupancy of the Building, the Developer shall submit a report documenting the completion of the abatement work to 2FM for its review and approval. If the abatement work is not deemed sufficient by 2FM, the Developer shall continue the work until approved.

22.4 Release and Indemnification. The Developer, on behalf of itself and the other Developer Parties, or anyone claiming by, through, or under the Developer Parties, hereby
releases, relinquishes and forever discharges the City from and against any and all Losses which the Developer or any of the Developer Parties ever had, now have, or hereafter may have, whether grounded in tort or contract or otherwise, in any and all courts or other forums, of whatever kind or nature, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, now existing or occurring after the Closing Date, based upon, arising out of or in any way connected with, directly or indirectly (a) any environmental contamination, pollution or hazards associated with the Property or any improvements, facilities or operations located or formerly located thereon, including, without limitation, any release, emission, discharge, generation, transportation, treatment, storage or disposal of Hazardous Substances, or threatened release, emission or discharge of Hazardous Substances; (b) the structural, physical or environmental condition of the Property, including, without limitation, the presence or suspected presence of Hazardous Substances in, on, under or about the Property or the migration of Hazardous Substances from or to other property, unless the Hazardous Substances migrate from property owned by the City to the Property; (c) any violation of, compliance with, enforcement of or liability under any Environmental Laws, including, without limitation, any Losses arising under CERCLA, and (d) any investigation, cleanup, monitoring, remedial, removal or restoration work required by any federal, state or local governmental agency or political subdivision or other third party in connection or associated with the Property or any improvements, facilities or operations located or formerly located thereon (collectively, "Released Claims"). Furthermore, the Developer shall defend (through an attorney reasonably acceptable to the City), indemnify, and hold the City harmless from and against any and all Losses which may be made or asserted by any third parties (including, without limitation, any of the Developer Parties) arising out of or in any way connected with, directly or indirectly, any of the Released Claims.

22.5 Release Runs with the Land. The covenant of release in Section 22.4 shall run with the Property, and shall be binding upon all successors and assigns of the Developer with respect to the Property, including, without limitation, each and every person, firm, corporation, limited liability company, trust or other entity owning, leasing, occupying, using, or possessing any portion of the Property under or through the Developer following the date of the Deed. The Developer acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing covenant of release constitutes a material inducement to the City to enter into this Agreement, and that, but for such release, the City would not have agreed to convey the Property to the Developer for the Purchase Price. It is expressly agreed and understood by and between the Developer and the City that, should any future obligation of the Developer, or any of the Developer Parties, arise or be alleged to arise in connection with any environmental, soil or other condition of the Property, neither the Developer, nor any of the Developer Parties, will assert that those obligations must be satisfied in whole or in part by the City because Section 22.4 contains a full, complete and final release of all such claims.

22.6 Survival. This Section 22 shall survive the Closing or any termination of this Agreement (regardless of the reason for such termination).

SECTION 23. DEVELOPER'S EMPLOYMENT OBLIGATIONS.

23.1 Employment Opportunity. The Developer agrees, and shall contractually obligate its various contractors, subcontractors and any Affiliate of the Developer operating on the Property (collectively, the "Employers" and individually, an "Employer") to agree, that with respect to the provision of services in connection with the construction of the Project:

(a) Neither the Developer nor any Employer shall discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment based upon race, religion, color, sex, national origin

The Developer and each Employer shall take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are hired and employed without discrimination based upon the foregoing grounds, and are treated in a non-discriminatory manner with regard to all job-related matters, including, without limitation: employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training, including apprenticeship. The Developer and each Employer agrees to post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for employment, notices to be provided by the City setting forth the provisions of this nondiscrimination clause. In addition, the Developer and each Employer, in all solicitations or advertisements for employees, shall state that all qualified applicants shall receive consideration for employment without discrimination based upon the foregoing grounds.

(b) To the greatest extent feasible, the Developer and each Employer shall (i) present opportunities for training and employment of low and moderate income residents of the City, and (ii) provide that contracts for work in connection with the construction of the Project be awarded to business concerns which are located in or owned in substantial part by persons residing in, the City.

(c) The Developer and each Employer shall comply with all federal, state and local equal employment and affirmative action statutes, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the Human Rights Ordinance and the Illinois Human Rights Act, 775 ILCS 5/1-101 et seq. (1993), both as amended from time to time, and any regulations promulgated thereunder.

(d) The Developer, in order to demonstrate compliance with the terms of this Section 23.1, shall cooperate with and promptly and accurately respond to inquiries by the City, which has the responsibility to observe and report compliance with equal employment opportunity regulations of federal, state and municipal agencies.

(e) The Developer and each Employer shall include the foregoing provisions of subparagraphs (a) through (d) in every contract entered into in connection with the construction of the Project, and shall require inclusion of these provisions in every subcontract entered into by any subcontractors, and every agreement with any affiliate operating on the Property, so that each such provision shall be binding upon each contractor, subcontractor or affiliate, as the case may be.

(f) Failure to comply with the employment obligations described in this Section 23.1 shall be a basis for the City to pursue remedies under the provisions of Section 19.

The Developer hereby represents and warrants that no violation of Section 2-145-030 (b) has occurred with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

SECTION 27. PROHIBITION ON CERTAIN CONTRIBUTIONS PURSUANT TO MAYORAL EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 2011-4.

27.1 The Developer agrees that the Developer, any person or entity who directly or indirectly has an ownership or beneficial interest in the Developer of more than 7.5 percent ("Owners"), spouses and domestic partners of such Owners, the Developer's contractors (i.e., any person or entity in direct contractual privity with the Developer regarding the subject matter of this Agreement) ("Contractors"), any person or entity who directly or indirectly has an ownership or beneficial interest in any Contractor of more than 7.5 percent ("Sub-owners") and spouses and domestic partners of such Sub-owners (such Owners and all other preceding classes of persons and entities, collectively the "Identified Parties"), shall not make a contribution of any amount to the Mayor of the City of Chicago or to his political fundraising committee (a) after execution of this Agreement by the Developer, (b) while this Agreement or any Other Contract (as hereinafter defined) is executory, (c) during the term of this Agreement or any Other Contract, or (d) during any period while an extension of this Agreement or any Other Contract is being sought or negotiated. This provision shall not apply to contributions made prior to May 16, 2011, the effective date of Executive Order 2011-4.

27.2 The Developer represents and warrants that from the later of (a) May 16, 2011, or (b) the date the City approached the Developer, or the date the Developer approached the City, as applicable, regarding the formulation of this Agreement, no Identified Parties have made a contribution of any amount to the Mayor or to his political fundraising committee.

27.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Developer agrees that a violation of, non-compliance with, misrepresentation with respect to, or breach of any
covenant or warranty under this Section 27 or violation of Mayoral Executive Order No. 2011-4 constitutes a breach and default under this Agreement, and under any Other Contract for which no opportunity to cure will be granted, unless the City, in its sole discretion, elects to grant such an opportunity to cure. Such breach and default entitles the City to all remedies (including, without limitation, termination for default) under this Agreement, and under any Other Contract, at law and in equity. This provision amends any Other Contract and supersedes any inconsistent provision contained therein.

27.6 If the Developer intentionally violates this provision or Mayoral Executive Order No. 2011-4 prior to the Closing, the City may elect to decline to close the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

(iii) the partners are not related by blood closer than would bar marriage in the State of Illinois; and

(iv) each partner is at least 18 years of age, and the partners are the same sex, and the partners reside at the same residence; and

(v) two of the following four conditions exist for the partners:

(1) The partners have been residing together for at least 12 months.

(2) The partners have common or joint ownership of a residence.

(3) The partners have at least two of the following arrangements:

SECTION 28. INSPECTOR GENERAL.

It is the duty of every officer, employee, department, agency, contractor, subcontractor, developer and licensee of the City, and every applicant for certification of eligibility for a City contract or program, to cooperate with the City's Inspector General in any investigation or hearing undertaken pursuant to Chapter 2-56 of the Municipal Code. The Developer understands and will abide by all provisions of Chapter 2-56 of the Municipal Code.

SECTION 29. WASTE ORDINANCE PROVISIONS.

During the period while this Agreement is executory, any violation of the Waste Sections by the Developer, its General Contractor or any subcontractor, whether or not relating to the performance of this Agreement, constitutes a breach of and an event of default under this Agreement, for which the opportunity to cure, if curable, will be granted only at the sole discretion of the Commissioner of DPD. Such breach and default entitles the City to all remedies under this Agreement, at law or in equity. This section does not limit the duty of the Developer, the General Contractor and any subcontractors to comply with all applicable Laws, in effect now or later, and whether or not they appear in this Agreement. Non-compliance with these terms and conditions may be used by the City as grounds for the termination of this Agreement, and may further affect the Developer's eligibility for future contract awards.

SECTION 30. 2014 CITY HIRING PLAN.

30.1 The City is subject to the June 16, 2014 "City of Chicago Hiring Plan" (as amended, the "2014 City Hiring Plan") entered in Shakman v. Democratic Organization of Cook County, Case No 69 C 2145 (United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois). Among other things, the 2014 City Hiring Plan prohibits the City from hiring persons as governmental employees in non-exempt positions on the basis of political reasons or factors.

30.2 The Developer is aware that City policy prohibits City employees from directing any individual to apply for a position with the Developer, either as an employee or as a subcontractor, and from directing the Developer to hire an individual as an employee or as a subcontractor. Accordingly, the Developer must follow its own hiring and contracting procedures, without being influenced by City employees. Any and all personnel provided by the Developer under this Agreement are employees or subcontractors of the Developer, not employees of the City of Chicago. This Agreement is not intended to and does not constitute, create, give rise to, or otherwise recognize an employer-employee relationship of any kind between the City and any personnel provided by the Developer.
30.3 The Developer will not condition, base, or knowingly prejudice or affect any term or aspect to the employment of any personnel provided under this Agreement, or offer employment to any individual to provide services under this Agreement, based upon or because of any political reason or factor, including, without limitation, any individual's political affiliation, membership in a political organization or party, political support or activity, political financial contributions, promises of such political support, activity or financial contributions, or such individual's political sponsorship or recommendation. For purposes of this Agreement, a political organization or party is an identifiable group or entity that has as its primary purpose the support of or opposition to candidates for elected public office. Individual political activities are the activities of individual persons in support of or in opposition to political organizations or parties or candidates for elected public office.

30.4 In the event of any communication to the Developer by a City employee or City official in violation of Section 30.2 above, or advocating a violation of Section 30.3 above, the Developer will, as soon as is reasonably practicable, report such communication to the Hiring Oversight Section of the City's Office of the Inspector General (the "OIG"), and also to the head of the relevant City department utilizing services provided under this Agreement. The Developer will also cooperate with any inquiries by the OIG.

SECTION 31. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ELIGIBILITY TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE CITY.

Failure by the Developer or any controlling person (as defined in Section 1-23-010 of the Municipal Code) thereof to maintain eligibility to do business with the City of Chicago as required by Section 1-23-030 of the Municipal Code shall be grounds for termination of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. The Developer shall at all times comply with Section 2-154-020 of the Municipal Code.

The following general provisions govern this Agreement:

32.1 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which, taken together, shall constitute a single, integrated instrument.

32.5 Entire Agreement: Modification. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior
agreements, negotiations and discussions. This Agreement may not be modified or amended in any manner without the prior written consent of the Parties hereto.

32.7 Force Majeure. None of the City, the Developer, nor any successor in interest to any of them shall be considered in breach of or in default of its obligations under this Agreement in the event of a delay due to unforeseeable events or conditions beyond the reasonable control of the Party affected which in fact interferes with the ability of such Party to discharge its obligations hereunder, including, without limitation, fires, floods, strikes, shortages of material and unusually severe weather or delays of subcontractors due to such causes. The time for the performance of the obligations shall be extended only for the period of the delay and only if the Party relying on this section requests an extension in writing within twenty (20) days after the beginning of any such delay.

32.14 No Waiver. No waiver by the City with respect to any specific default by the Developer shall be deemed to be a waiver of the rights of the City with respect to any other defaults of the Developer, nor shall any forbearance by the City to seek a remedy for any breach or default be deemed a waiver of its rights and remedies with respect to such breach or default, nor shall the City be deemed to have waived any of its rights and remedies unless such waiver is in writing.

32.15 Severability. If any term of this Agreement or any application thereof is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid part were never included herein and this Agreement shall be and remain valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

SECTION 16. PROHIBITION AGAINST SALE OR TRANSFER OF PROPERTY.

Prior to the issuance of the Certificate of Completion for the Project, the Developer may not, without the prior written consent of DPD, which consent shall be in DPD's sole but reasonable discretion: (a) directly or indirectly sell, transfer, convey, or otherwise dispose of all or any portion of the Property or the Project or any interest therein to any person or entity that is not an Affiliate of the Developer; or (b) directly or indirectly assign this Agreement (other than to a lender for collateral assignment purposes as permitted under Section 17). The Developer acknowledges and agrees that DPD may withhold its consent under (a) or (b) above if, among other reasons, the proposed purchaser, transferee or assignee (or such entity's principal officers or directors) is in violation of any Laws, or if the Developer fails to submit sufficient evidence of the financial responsibility, business background and reputation of the proposed purchaser, transferee or assignee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as the Developer will need to raise approximately 40% of the Approved Project Costs in equity and will need to admit each equity investor as a member of the Developer entity, the Developer may transfer membership interests in the Developer entity to such equity investors without the City's approval, provided that the Developer's manager is Leon I.

Prior to the issuance of the Certificate of Completion for the Project, the Developer may not, without the prior written consent of DPD, which consent shall be in DPD's sole but reasonable discretion, engage in any financing or other transaction which would create an encumbrance or lien on the Property, except for the Lender Financing, if any, approved pursuant to Section 9, which shall be limited to funds necessary to construct the Project. The Developer shall provide to the Corporation Counsel a subordination
agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to the City, to be executed and recorded concurrently with the Developer's closing on any Lender Financing, subordinating any liens against the City Property related to any Lender Financing.

17.2 Mortgagees Not Obligated to Construct. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or of the Deed, the holder of any mortgage authorized by this Agreement (or any affiliate of such holder) shall not itself be obligated to construct or complete the Project, or to guarantee such construction or completion, but shall be bound by the other covenants running with the land specified in Section 18 and, at the Closing, shall execute a subordination agreement in accordance with Section 10.10. If any such mortgagee or its affiliate succeeds to the Developer's interest in the Property (or any portion thereof) prior to the issuance of the Certificate of Completion, whether by foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or otherwise, and thereafter transfers its interest in the Property (or any portion thereof) to another party, such transferee shall be obligated to complete the Project, and shall also be bound by the other covenants running with the land specified in Section 18.

SECTION 18. COVENANTS RUNNING WITH THE LAND.

Such covenants, agreements, releases and other terms and provisions shall terminate as follows:

| SECTION | COVENANT                        | TERMINATION                                      |

(b) the making or furnishing by the Developer of any warranty, representation, statement, certification, schedule or report to the City (whether in this Agreement, an Economic Disclosure Statement, or another document) which is untrue or misleading in any material respect;

(c) except as otherwise permitted hereunder, the creation (whether voluntary or involuntary) of, or any attempt to create, any lien or other encumbrance upon the Property or the Project, or the making or any attempt to make any levy, seizure or attachment thereof;

(d) the commencement of any proceedings in bankruptcy by or against the Developer or the liquidation or reorganization of the Developer, or alleging that the Developer is insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they mature, or for the readjustment or arrangement of the Developer's debts, whether under the United States Bankruptcy Code or under any other state or federal law, now or hereafter existing, for the relief of debtors, or the commencement of any analogous statutory or non-statutory proceedings involving the Developer; provided, however, that if such commencement of proceedings is involuntary, such action shall not constitute an Event of Default unless such proceedings are not dismissed within sixty (60) days after the commencement of such proceedings;

(e) the appointment of a receiver or trustee for the Developer, for any substantial part of the Developer's assets or the institution of any proceedings for the dissolution, or the full or partial liquidation, or the merger or consolidation, of the Developer; provided, however, that if such appointment or commencement of proceedings is involuntary, such action shall not constitute an Event of Default unless such appointment is not revoked or such proceedings are not dismissed within sixty (60) days after the commencement thereof;

(f) the entry of any judgment or order against the Developer which is related to the Property and remains unsatisfied or undischarged and in effect for sixty (60) days after such entry without a stay of enforcement or execution;

(g) the occurrence of an event of default under the Lender Financing, which default is not cured within any applicable cure period; and

(h) the dissolution of the Developer.

19.3 Cure. If the Developer defaults in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the Developer shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of default from the City to cure the default, or such longer period as shall be reasonably necessary to cure such default, provided the Developer promptly commences such cure and thereafter diligently pursues such cure to completion (so long as continuation of the default does not create material risk of damage to the improvements comprising the Project or injury to persons using the Project). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, there shall be no notice requirement or cure period with respect to Events of Default described in Section 16 (Prohibition Against Transfer of Property) if the City is legally prohibited from doing business with the Developer as a result of such Event of Default.
19.4 Default Prior to Issuance of Certificate of Completion and Reconveyance. If an Event of Default occurs prior to the issuance of the Certificate of Completion, and the default is not cured in the time period provided for in Section 19.3 above, the City may terminate this Agreement and pursue and secure any available remedy against the Developer in any court of competent jurisdiction by any action or proceeding at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, damages, injunctive relief, the specific performance of the agreements contained herein, and the right to revest title to the City Property in the City pursuant to the Reconveyance Deed; provided, however, that the recording of the Reconveyance Deed shall not defeat, render invalid, or limit in any way, the lien of any mortgage authorized by this Agreement. If the Reconveyance Deed is recorded by the City, the Developer shall be responsible for all real estate taxes and assessments which accrued during the period the City Property was owned by the Developer, and the Developer shall cause the release of all unpermitted liens or encumbrances placed on the City Property during the period of time the City Property was owned by the Developer. The Developer will cooperate with the City to ensure that if the City records the Reconveyance Deed, such recording is effective for purposes of transferring title to the City Property to the City.

19.5 Resale of the City Property. Upon the reconveyance of the City Property to the City as provided in Section 19.4, the City may convey the City Property to a qualified and financially responsible party reasonably acceptable to the first mortgagee (if any), who (at its own cost) may, if possible, assume the obligation of completing that portion of the Project located on the City Property, or such other improvements as shall be reasonably satisfactory to DPD (if the Project has not been completed or cannot be built on the City Property given the necessity of building on the Developer Parcel as well), and otherwise comply with the covenants that run with the land as specified in Section 18.

19.6 Disposition of Resale Proceeds. If the City sells the City Property as provided for in Section 19.5, the net proceeds from the sale, after payment of all amounts owed under any mortgage liens authorized by this Agreement in order of lien priority, shall be utilized to reimburse the City for:

(a) the dollar amount by which the City wrote-down the value of the City Property when the City conveyed the City Property to the Developer, if any; and

(b) costs and expenses incurred by the City (excluding salaries and benefits of the City's personnel) in connection with the recapture, management and resale of the City Property (less any income derived by the City from the City Property in connection with such management); and

(c) all costs to remediate the City Property; and

(d) all unpaid taxes, assessments, and water and sewer charges assessed against the City Property; and

(e) any payments made (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs) to discharge or prevent from attaching or being made any subsequent encumbrances or liens due to obligations, defaults or acts of the Developer; and

(f) any expenditures made or obligations incurred with respect to construction or maintenance of the Project; and
(g) any other amounts owed to the City by the Developer.

The Developer shall be entitled to receive any remaining proceeds.

SECTION 20. CONFLICT OF INTEREST; CITY'S REPRESENTATIVES NOT INDIVIDUALLY LIABLE.

The Developer represents and warrants that no agent, official or employee of the City shall have any personal interest, direct or indirect, in the Developer, this Agreement, the City Property or the Project, nor shall any such agent, official or employee participate in any decision relating to this Agreement which affects his or her personal interests or the interests of any corporation, partnership, association or other entity in which he or she is directly or indirectly interested. No agent, official, director, officer, trustee or employee of the City or the Developer shall be personally liable in the event of any default under or breach of this Agreement or for any amount which may become due with respect to any commitment or obligation under the terms of this Agreement.

SECTION 21. INDEMNIFICATION.

The Developer agrees to indemnify, pay, defend and hold the City, and its elected and appointed officials, employees and agents (individually, an "Indemnitee," and collectively the "Indemnitees") harmless from and against any and all Losses in connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding commenced or threatened, whether or not such Indemnitees shall be designated a party thereto, that may be imposed upon, suffered, incurred by or asserted against the Indemnitees in any manner relating to or arising out of: (a) the failure of the Developer to comply with any of the terms, covenants and conditions applicable to the Developer and contained within this Agreement; (b) the failure of the Developer or any Agent of the Developer to pay contractors, subcontractors or material suppliers in connection with the construction and management of the Project; (c) any misrepresentation or omission made by the Developer or any Agent in connection with this Agreement; (d) the failure of the Developer to redress any misrepresentation or omission in this Agreement or any other document relating hereto; and (e) any activity undertaken by the Developer or any Agent or Affiliate of the Developer on the Property prior to or after the Closing. This indemnification shall survive the Closing and any termination of this Agreement (regardless of the reason for such termination).

SECTION 22. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

22.1 "AS IS" SALE. THE DEVELOPER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS HAD AN ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY TO INSPECT THE CITY PROPERTY AND EVALUATE THE STRUCTURAL, PHYSICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND RISKS OF THE CITY PROPERTY AND ACCEPTS THE RISK THAT ANY INSPECTION MAY NOT DISCLOSE ALL MATERIAL MATTERS AFFECTING THE CITY PROPERTY (AND ANY IMPROVEMENTS THEREON). THE DEVELOPER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS RELYING SOLELY UPON ITS OWN INSPECTION AND OTHER DUE DILIGENCE ACTIVITIES IN DECIDING WHETHER TO ACQUIRE THE CITY PROPERTY, AND NOT UPON ANY INFORMATION (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES OR REPORTS OF ANY KIND) PROVIDED BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OR ITS AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES WITH RESPECT THERETO. THE DEVELOPER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE CITY PROPERTY IS BEING CONVEYED, AND THE DEVELOPER AGREES TO ACCEPT THE CITY PROPERTY, IN ITS "AS IS," "WHERE IS" AND "WITH ALL FAULTS" CONDITION AT CLOSING, WITHOUT ANY COVENANT, REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
OF ANY KIND, AS TO THE STRUCTURAL, PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION OF
THE CITY PROPERTY (OR ANY IMPROVEMENTS THEREON), ITS COMPLIANCE WITH ANY
LAWS, OR THE SUITABILITY OR MERCHANTABILITY OF THE CITY PROPERTY FOR ANY
PURPOSE WHATSOEVER. THE DEVELOPER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT IT IS
SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INVESTIGATION AND REMEDIATION WORK
NECESSARY TO PUT THE CITY PROPERTY IN A CONDITION WHICH IS SUITABLE FOR ITS
INTENDED USE.

22.2 Environmental Investigation. The City shall grant the Developer the right, at its
sole cost and expense, and in the City's customary form and subject to the City's receipt from the
Developer of all required documentation (e.g., evidence of insurance), to enter the City Property
to perform any surveys, environmental assessments, soil tests and other due diligence it deems
necessary or desirable to satisfy itself as to the condition of the City Property; provided, however,
that the City shall have the right to review and approve the scope of work for any environmental
testing. If the Developer determines that it is not satisfied, in its sole and absolute discretion, with
the condition of the City Property, it may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the City
delivered any time prior to the Closing Date, whereupon this Agreement shall be null and void
and, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, neither Party shall have any further right,
duty or obligation hereunder. If the Developer elects not to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 22.2, the Developer shall be deemed satisfied with the condition of the Property.

22.3 Environmental Remediation. The Developer has obtained a Phase I ESA of the
Property dated June 7, 2023. The Phase I ESA identified a number of Recognized Environmental
Conditions ("RECs"), as follows:

(a) Contamination is known to be present on the Property. Therefore, the
Developer shall enroll the Property in the IEPA's Site Remediation Program (the "SRP")
in order to obtain the NFR for the Property. The Developer acknowledges and agrees that
it may not commence construction on the Property or commence any other activity on the
Property that could interfere with the prompt start and completion of the RAP until the
IEPA issues a Remedial Action Plan Approval Letter ("RAP Approval Letter") for the
Property.

Upon receipt of the RAP Approval Letter for the Property, the Developer covenants and
agrees to promptly complete all Remediation Work necessary to obtain the NFR for the
Property using all reasonable means. The City shall have the right to review in advance
and approve all documents submitted to the IEPA under the SRP, as amended or
supplemented from time to time, including, without limitation, the SRP Documents and any
changes thereto, and the Developer's estimate of the cost to perform the Remediation
Work. The Developer shall bear sole responsibility for all costs of the Remediation Work
necessary to obtain the NFR, and the costs of any other investigative and cleanup
associated with the Property. The Developer shall promptly transmit to the City copies of
all Environmental Documents prepared or received with respect to the Remediation Work,
including, without limitation, any written communications delivered to or received from the
IEPA or other regulatory agencies. The Developer acknowledges and agrees that it will
not request a certificate of occupancy for the Project from the Department of Buildings
(DOB) until the IEPA has issued the NFR (to the extent required), the City has approved
it (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), and the
Developer has recorded it with the Cook County Clerk's Office. If the Developer fails to
obtain the NFR within one (1) year of the submission of the Remedial Action Completion
Report ("RACR") to the IEPA,
(b) The Developer acknowledges that, except in the case of information specifically designated by the Developer to be treated confidentially as a trade secret or secret process, the City may make publicly available (i) environmental assessments, (ii) hazardous material building surveys, (iii) IEPA site remediation program submittals, or (iv) similar environmental documents relating to the Property, and the Developer consents to the City's publication of those documents.

(c) The Developer must abide by the terms and conditions of the NFR and must inform any subsequent owner and tenants of the Property to abide by the terms of the NFR.

(d) The Developer shall cooperate and consult with the City at all relevant times (and in all cases upon the City's request) with respect to environmental matters. 2FM shall have the right to review and approve the sufficiency of the Phase I and Phase II ESAs (if needed). The City must be named in a reliance letter for all environmental assessment reports produced concerning the Property.

(e) The Developer shall remove any soil or soil gas not meeting the requirements of 35 IAC Section 742.305. Any underground storage tanks ("USTs") identified must be removed and closed in accordance with applicable regulations including Title 41 of IAC Part 175 and any identified leaking USTs must be properly addressed in accordance with 35 IAC Part 734.

22.4 Release and Indemnification. The Developer, on behalf of itself and the Developer Parties, hereby releases, relinquishes and forever discharges the Indemnitees from and against any and all Losses which the Developer or any of the Developer Parties ever had, now have, or hereafter may have, whether grounded in tort or contract or otherwise, in any and all courts or other forums, of whatever kind or nature, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, now existing or occurring after the Closing Date, based upon, arising out of or in any way connected with, directly or indirectly (i) any environmental contamination, pollution or hazards associated with the City Property or any improvements, facilities or operations located or formerly located thereon, including, without limitation, any release, emission, discharge, generation, transportation, treatment, storage or disposal of Hazardous Substances (ii) the structural, physical or environmental condition of the City Property, including, without limitation, the presence or suspected presence of Hazardous Substances or Other Regulated Material in, on, under or about the City Property or the migration of Hazardous Substances or Other Regulated Material from or to other property; (iii) any violation of, compliance with, enforcement of or liability under any Environmental Laws, including, without limitation, any governmental or regulatory body response costs, natural resource Losses arising under CERCLA; and (iv) any investigation, cleanup, monitoring, remedial, removal or restoration work required by any federal, state or local governmental agency or political subdivision in connection or associated with the City Property or any improvements, facilities or operations located or formerly located thereon (collectively, "Released Claims"). Furthermore, the Developer shall indemnify, defend (through an attorney reasonably acceptable to the City) and hold the Indemnitees harmless from and against any and all Losses which may be made or asserted by any third parties (including, without limitation, any of the Developer Parties) arising out of or in any way connected with, directly or indirectly, any of the Released Claims. The Developer Parties waive their rights of contribution and subrogation against the Indemnified Parties.
22.5 Release Runs with the Land. The covenant of release in Section 22.4 shall run with the City Property, and shall be binding upon all successors and assigns of the Developer with respect to the City Property, including, without limitation, each and every person, firm, corporation, limited liability company, trust or other entity owning, leasing, occupying, using or possessing any portion of the City Property under or through the Developer following the date of the Deed. The Developer acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing covenant of release constitutes a material inducement to the City to enter into this Agreement, and that, but for such release, the City would not have agreed to convey the City Property to the Developer for the Purchase Price. It is expressly agreed and understood by and between the Developer and the City that, should any future obligation of the Developer, or any of the Developer Parties, arise or be alleged to arise in connection with any environmental, soil or other condition of the City Property, neither the Developer, nor any of the Developer Parties, will assert that those obligations must be satisfied in whole or in part by the City because Section 22.4 contains a full, complete and final release of all such claims.

22.6 Survival. This Section 22 shall survive the Closing or any termination of this Agreement (regardless of the reason for such termination).

SECTION 23. DEVELOPER'S EMPLOYMENT OBLIGATIONS.

23.1 Employment Opportunity. The Developer agrees, and shall contractually obligate its various contractors, subcontractors and any Affiliate of the Developer operating on the Property (collectively, the "Employers" and individually, an "Employer") to agree, that with respect to the provision of services in connection with the construction of the Project:

(a) Neither the Developer nor any Employer shall discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment based upon race, religion, color, sex, national origin or ancestry, age, handicap or disability, sexual orientation, military discharge status, marital status, parental status or source of income as defined in the City of Chicago Human Rights Ordinance, Section 2-160-010 et seq. of the Municipal Code, as amended from time to time (the "Human Rights Ordinance"). The Developer and each Employer shall take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are hired and employed without discrimination based upon the foregoing grounds, and are treated in a non-discriminatory manner with regard to all job-related matters, including, without limitation: employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training, including apprenticeship. The Developer and each Employer agrees to post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for employment, notices to be provided by the City setting forth the provisions of this nondiscrimination clause. In addition, the Developer and each Employer, in all solicitations or advertisements for employees, shall state that all qualified applicants shall receive consideration for employment without discrimination based upon the foregoing grounds.

(b) To the greatest extent feasible, the Developer and each Employer shall (i) present opportunities for training and employment of low- and moderate-income residents of the City, and (ii) provide that contracts for work in connection with the construction of the Project be awarded to business concerns which are located in or owned in substantial part by persons residing in the City.

(c) The Developer and each Employer shall comply with all federal, state and local equal employment and affirmative action statutes, rules and regulations, including,
without limitation, the Human Rights Ordinance and the Illinois Human Rights Act, 775 ILCS 5/1-101 et seq. (1993), both as amended from time to time, and any regulations promulgated thereunder.

(d) The Developer, in order to demonstrate compliance with the terms of this Section 23.1, shall cooperate with and promptly and accurately respond to inquiries by the City, which has the responsibility to observe and report compliance with equal employment opportunity regulations of federal, state and municipal agencies.

(e) The Developer and each Employer shall include the foregoing provisions of subparagraphs (a) through (d) in every contract entered into in connection with the construction of the Project, and shall require inclusion of these provisions in every subcontract entered into by any subcontractors, and every agreement with any affiliate operating on the Property, so that each such provision shall be binding upon each contractor, subcontractor or affiliate, as the case may be.

(f) Failure to comply with the employment obligations described in this Section 23.1 shall be a basis for the City to pursue remedies under the provisions of Section 19.

23.2 City Resident Employment Requirement.

(a) The Developer agrees, and shall contractually obligate each Employer to agree, that during the construction of the Project, the Developer and each Employer shall comply with the minimum percentage of total worker hours performed by actual residents of the City of Chicago as specified in Section 2-92-330 of the Municipal Code (at least 50%; provided, however, that in addition to complying with this percentage, the Developer and each Employer shall be required to make good faith efforts to utilize qualified residents of the City in both unskilled and skilled labor positions.

(b) The Developer and the Employers may request a reduction or waiver of this minimum percentage level of Chicagoans as provided for in Section 2-92-330 of the Municipal Code in accordance with standards and procedures developed by the chief procurement officer of the City.

(c) "Actual residents of the City of Chicago" shall mean persons domiciled within the City of Chicago. The domicile is an individual's one and only true, fixed and permanent home and principal establishment.

(d) The Developer and the Employers shall provide for the maintenance of adequate employee residency records to ensure that actual Chicago residents are employed on the construction of the Project. The Developer and the Employers shall maintain copies of personal documents supportive of every Chicago employee's actual record of residence.

(e) The Developer and the Employers shall submit weekly certified payroll reports (U.S. Department of Labor Form WH-347 or equivalent) to DPD in triplicate, which shall identify clearly the actual residence of every employee on each submitted certified payroll. The first time that an employee's name appears on a payroll, the date that the Developer or the Employer hired the employee should be written in after the employee's name.
(f) The Developer and the Employers shall provide full access to their employment records to the chief procurement officer, DPD, the Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department, the inspector general, or any duly authorized representative thereof. The Developer and the Employers shall maintain all relevant personnel data and records for a period of at least three (3) years after the issuance of the Certificate of Completion.

(g) At the direction of DPD, the Developer and the Employers shall provide affidavits and other supporting documentation to verify or clarify an employee's actual address when doubt or lack of clarity has arisen.

(h) Good faith efforts on the part of the Developer and the Employers to provide work for actual Chicago residents (but not sufficient for the granting of a waiver request as provided for in the standards and procedures developed by the chief procurement officer) shall not suffice to replace the actual, verified achievement of the requirements of this Section 23.2 concerning the worker hours performed by actual Chicago residents.

(i) If the City determines that the Developer or an Employer failed to ensure the fulfillment of the requirements of this Section 23.2 concerning the worker hours performed by actual Chicago residents or failed to report in the manner as indicated above, the City will thereby be damaged in the failure to provide the benefit of demonstrable employment to Chicagoans to the degree stipulated in this Section 23.2. If such non-compliance is not remedied in accordance with the breach and cure provisions of Section 19.3, the parties agree that 1/20 of 1 percent (.05%) of the aggregate hard construction costs set forth in the Budget shall be surrendered by the Developer to the City in payment for each percentage of shortfall toward the stipulated residency requirement. Failure to report the residency of employees entirely and correctly shall result in the surrender of the entire liquidated damages as if no Chicago residents were employed in either of the categories. The willful falsification of statements and the certification of payroll data may subject the Developer and/or the other Employers or employees to prosecution.

(j) Nothing herein provided shall be construed to be a limitation upon the "Notice of Requirements for Affirmative Action to Ensure Equal Employment Opportunity, Executive Order 11246" and "Standard Federal Equal Employment Opportunity, Executive Order 11246," or other affirmative action required for equal opportunity under the provisions of this Agreement.

(k) The Developer shall cause or require the provisions of this Section 23.2 to be included in all construction contracts and subcontracts related to the construction of the Project.

23.3 Developer's MBE/WBE Commitment. The Developer agrees for itself and its successors and assigns, and, if necessary to meet the requirements set forth herein, shall contractually obligate the General Contractor to agree, that during the construction of the Project:

(a) Consistent with the findings which support, as applicable, (i) the Minority-Owned and Women-Owned Business Enterprise Procurement Program, Section 2-92-420 et seq., Municipal Code (the "Procurement Program"), and (ii) the Minority- and Women-Owned Business Enterprise Construction Program, Section 2-92-650 et seq., Municipal
Code (the "Construction Program," and collectively with the Procurement Program, the "MBE/WBE Program"), and in reliance upon the provisions of the MBE/WBE Program to the extent contained in, and as qualified by, the provisions of this Section 23.3, during the course of construction of the Project, at least 26% of the aggregate hard construction costs shall be expended for contract participation by minority-owned businesses and at least 6% of the aggregate hard construction costs shall be expended for contract participation by women-owned businesses.

(b) For purposes of this Section 23.3 only:

(i) The Developer (and any party to whom a contract is let by the Developer in connection with the Project) shall be deemed a "contractor" and this Agreement (and any contract let by the Developer in connection with the Project) shall be deemed a "contract" or a "construction contract" as such terms are defined in Sections 2-92-420 and 2-92-670 of the Municipal Code, as applicable.

(ii) The term "minority-owned business" or "MBE" shall mean a business identified in the Directory of Certified Minority Business Enterprises published by the City's Department of Procurement Services, or otherwise certified by the City's Department of Procurement Services as a minority-owned business enterprise, related to the Procurement Program or the Construction Program, as applicable.

(iii) The term "women-owned business" or "WBE" shall mean a business identified in the Directory of Certified Women Business Enterprises published by the City's Department of Procurement Services, or otherwise certified by the City's Department of Procurement Services as a women-owned business enterprise, related to the Procurement Program or the Construction Program, as applicable.

(c) Consistent with Sections 2-92-440 and 2-92-720 of the Municipal Code, the Developer's MBE/WBE commitment may be achieved in part by the Developer's status as an MBE or WBE (but only to the extent of any actual work performed on the Project by the Developer) or by a joint venture with one or more MBEs or WBEs (but only to the extent of the lesser of (i) the MBE or WBE participation in such joint venture, or (ii) the amount of any actual work performed on the Project by the MBE or WBE); by the Developer utilizing a MBE or a WBE as the General Contractor (but only to the extent of any actual work performed on the Project by the General Contractor); by subcontracting or causing the General Contractor to subcontract a portion of the construction of the Project to one or more MBEs or WBEs; by the purchase of materials or services used in the construction of the Project from one or more MBEs or WBEs; or by any combination of the foregoing. Those entities which constitute both an MBE and a WBE shall not be credited more than once with regard to the Developer's MBE/WBE commitment as described in this Section 23.3. In accordance with Section 2-92-730 of the Municipal Code, the Developer shall not substitute any MBE or WBE General Contractor or subcontractor without the prior written approval of DPD.

(d) The Developer shall deliver quarterly reports to the City's monitoring staff during the construction of the Project describing its efforts to achieve compliance with this MBE/WBE commitment. Such reports shall include, inter alia, the name and business address of each MBE and WBE solicited by the Developer or the General Contractor to
work on the Project, and the responses received from such solicitation, the name and business address of each MBE or WBE actually involved in the construction of the Project, a description of the work performed or products or services supplied, the date and amount of such work, product or service, and such other information as may assist the City's monitoring staff in determining the Developer's compliance with this MBE/WBE commitment. The Developer shall maintain records of all relevant data with respect to the utilization of MBEs and WBEs in connection with the construction of the Project for at least five (5) years after completion of the Project, and the City's monitoring staff shall have access to all such records maintained by the Developer, on prior notice of at least five (5) Business Days, to allow the City to review the Developer's compliance with its commitment to MBE/WBE participation and the status of any MBE or WBE performing any portion of the construction of the Project.

(e) Upon the disqualification of any MBE or WBE General Contractor or subcontractor, if the disqualified party misrepresented such status, the Developer shall be obligated to discharge or cause to be discharged the disqualified General Contractor or subcontractor, and, if possible, identify and engage a qualified MBE or WBE as a replacement. For purposes of this subsection (e), the disqualification procedures are further described in Sections 2-92-540 and 2-92-730 of the Municipal Code, as applicable.

(f) Any reduction or waiver of the Developer's MBE/WBE commitment as described in this Section 23.3 shall be undertaken in accordance with Sections 2-92-450 and 2-92-730 of the Municipal Code, as applicable.

23.4 Pre-Construction Conference and Post-Closing Compliance Requirements. Not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Developer and the Developer's General Contractor and all major subcontractors shall meet with DPD monitoring staff regarding compliance with all Section 23 requirements. During this pre-construction meeting, the Developer shall present its plan to achieve its obligations under this Section 23, the sufficiency of which the City's monitoring staff shall approve as a precondition to the Closing. During the construction of the Project, the Developer shall submit all documentation required by this Section 23 to the City's monitoring staff, including, without limitation, the following: (a) subcontractor's activity report; (b) contractor's certification concerning labor standards and prevailing wage requirements (if applicable); (c) contractor letter of understanding; (d) monthly utilization report; (e) authorization for payroll agent; (f) certified payroll; (g) evidence that MBE/WBE contractor associations have been informed of the Project via written notice and hearings; and (h) evidence of compliance with job creation/job retention requirements (if any). Failure to submit such documentation on a timely basis, or a determination by the City's monitoring staff, upon analysis of the documentation, that the Developer is not complying with its obligations under this Section 23, shall, upon the delivery of written notice to the Developer, be deemed an Event of Default and upon receipt of the City's notice of default, the Developer will have the cure period provided in Section 19.3 hereof. Upon the occurrence of any such Event of Default, in addition to any other remedies provided in this Agreement, the City may: (x) issue a written demand to the Developer to halt construction of the Project, (y) withhold any further payment of any City funds to the Developer or the General Contractor (if applicable), or (z) seek any other remedies against the Developer available at law or in equity.

SECTION 27. PROHIBITION ON CERTAIN CONTRIBUTIONS PURSUANT TO MAYORAL EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 2011-4.

27.1 The Developer agrees that the Developer, any person or entity who directly or indirectly has an ownership or beneficial interest in the Developer of more than 7.5 percent ("Owners"), spouses and domestic partners of such Owners, the Developer's contractors (i.e., any person or entity in direct contractual privity with the Developer regarding the subject matter of this Agreement) ("Contractors"), any person or entity who directly or indirectly has an ownership or beneficial interest in any Contractor of more than 7.5 percent ("Sub-owners") and spouses and domestic partners of such Sub-owners (such Owners and all other preceding classes of persons and entities, collectively the "Identified Parties"), shall not make a contribution of any amount to the Mayor of the City of Chicago or to his political fundraising committee (a) after execution of this Agreement by the Developer, (b) while this Agreement or any Other Contract (as hereinafter defined) is executory, (c) during the term of this Agreement or any Other Contract, or (d) during any period while an extension of this Agreement or any Other Contract is being sought or negotiated.

27.2 The Developer represents and warrants that from the later of (a) May 16, 2011, or (b) the date the City approached the Developer, or the date the Developer approached the City, as applicable, regarding the formulation of this Agreement, no Identified Parties have made a contribution of any amount to the Mayor or to his political fundraising committee.

27.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Developer agrees that a violation of, non-compliance with, misrepresentation with respect to, or breach of any covenant or warranty under this Section 27 or violation of Mayoral Executive Order No. 2011-4 constitutes an Event of Default under this Agreement, and a breach under any Other Contract for which no opportunity to cure will be granted, unless the City, in its sole discretion, elects to grant such an opportunity to cure. Such breach and default entitles the City to all remedies (including, without limitation, termination for default) under this Agreement, and under any Other Contract, at law and in equity. This provision amends any Other Contract and supersedes any inconsistent provision contained therein.

27.6 If the Developer intentionally violates this provision or Mayoral Executive Order No. 2011-4 prior to the Closing, the City may elect to decline to close the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 28. INSPECTOR GENERAL.

The Developer understands and will abide by all provisions of Chapter 2-56 of the Municipal Code.

SECTION 29. WASTE ORDINANCE PROVISIONS.

In accordance with Section 11-4-1600(e) of the Municipal Code, the Developer warrants and represents that it, and to the best of its knowledge, its contractors and subcontractors, have not violated and are not in violation of any provisions of Section 7-28 or Section 11-4 of the Municipal Code (the "Waste Sections"). During the period while this Agreement is executory, any violation of the Waste Sections by the Developer, its General Contractor or any subcontractor, whether or not relating to the performance of this Agreement, constitutes a breach of and an event of default under this Agreement, for which the opportunity to cure, if curable, will be granted only at the sole discretion of the Commissioner of DPD. Such breach and default entitles the City to all remedies under this Agreement, at law or in equity. This Section 29 does not limit the duty of the Developer, the General Contractor and any subcontractors to comply with all applicable Laws, in effect now or later, and whether or not they appear in this Agreement. Non-compliance with
these terms and conditions may be used by the City as grounds for the termination of this Agreement and may further affect the Developer's eligibility for future contract awards.

SECTION 30. 2014 CITY HIRING PLAN.

30.1 The City is subject to the June 16, 2014 "City of Chicago Hiring Plan" (as amended, the "2014 City Hiring Plan") entered in Shakman v. Democratic Organization of Cook County, Case No 69 C 2145 (United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois). Among other things, the 2014 City Hiring Plan prohibits the City from hiring persons as governmental employees in non-exempt positions on the basis of political reasons or factors.

30.2 The Developer is aware that the City's policies prohibit the City's employees from directing any individual to apply for a position with the Developer, either as an employee or as a subcontractor, and from directing the Developer to hire an individual as an employee or as a subcontractor. Accordingly, the Developer must follow its own hiring and contracting procedures, without being influenced by the City's employees. Any and all personnel hired by the Developer for the Project under this Agreement are employees or subcontractors of the Developer, not employees of the City. This Agreement is not intended to and does not constitute, create, give rise to, or otherwise recognize an employer-employee relationship of any kind between the City and any personnel hired by the Developer.

30.3 The Developer will not condition, base, or knowingly prejudice or affect any term or aspect to the employment of any personnel hired for the Project, or offer employment to any individual to provide services for the Project, based upon or because of any political reason or factor, including, without limitation, any individual's political affiliation, membership in a political organization or party, political support or activity, political financial contributions, promises of such political support, activity or financial contributions, or such individual's political sponsorship or recommendation. For purposes of this Agreement, a political organization or party is an identifiable group or entity that has as its primary purpose the support of or opposition to candidates for elected public office. Individual political activities are the activities of individual persons in support of or in opposition to political organizations or parties or candidates for elected public office.

30.4 In the event any employee or official of the City communicates with the Developer in violation of Section 30.2 above, or advocating a violation of Section 30.3 above, the Developer will, as soon as is reasonably practicable, report such communication to the Hiring Oversight Section of the City's Office of the Inspector General (the "OIG"), and also to the head of the relevant City department utilizing services provided under this Agreement. The Developer will also cooperate with any inquiries by the OIG.

SECTION 31. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ELIGIBILITY TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE CITY.

Failure by the Developer or any controlling person (as defined in Section 1-23-010 of the Municipal Code) thereof to maintain eligibility to do business with the City as required by Section 1-23-030 of the Municipal Code shall be grounds for termination of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. The Developer shall at all times comply with Section 2-154-020 of the Municipal Code.

32.5 Entire Agreement: Modification.

32.7 Force Majeure. None of the City, the Developer, nor any successor in interest to any of them shall be considered in breach of or in default of its obligations under this Agreement in the event of a delay due to unforeseeable events or conditions beyond the reasonable control of the party affected which in fact interferes with the ability of such party to discharge its obligations hereunder, including, without limitation, fires, floods, strikes, shortages of material, shipping delays, delays related to tariffs and other trade sanctions imposed on materials suppliers, shortage of labor, strikes, lockout, and other labor actions, pandemics or other federal health emergencies, and unusually severe weather or delays of subcontractors due to such causes.

32.13 **No Waiver.** No waiver by the City with respect to any specific default by the Developer shall be deemed to be a waiver of the rights of the City with respect to any other defaults of the Developer, nor shall any forbearance by the City to seek a remedy for any breach or default be deemed a waiver of its rights and remedies with respect to such breach or default, nor shall the City be deemed to have waived any of its rights and remedies unless such waiver is in writing.

32.14 **Severability.** If any term of this Agreement or any application thereof is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid part were never included herein, and this Agreement shall be and remain valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

include, but not be limited to, the following as shall be reviewed and determined by the Department of Transportation’s Division of Infrastructure Management:

-- Curb and gutter
-- Sidewalks

The Perimeter Restoration Agreement must be executed prior to any Department of Transportation and Planned Development Part II review permitting. The Agreement shall reflect that all work must comply with current Rules and Regulations and must be designed and constructed in accordance with the Department of Transportation’s Construction Standards for Work in the Public Way and in compliance with the Municipal Code of Chicago Chapter 10-20. Design of said improvements should follow the Department of Transportation’s Rules and Regulations for Construction in the Public Way as well as The Street and Site Plan Design Guidelines.

4. This plan of development consists of 18 Statements; a Bulk Regulations Table; an Existing Zoning Map; an Existing Land-Use Map; a Property Line Planned Development Boundary Map; Site Plan; and Building Elevations (North, East, South and West) prepared by FitzGerald Associates, dated January 16, 2025, and submitted herein.

In any instance where a provision of this Planned Development conflicts with the Chicago Building Code, the Building Code shall control. This Planned Development conforms to the intent and purpose of the Chicago Zoning Ordinance, and all requirements thereto, and satisfies the established criteria for approval as a Planned Development. In case of a conflict between the terms of this Planned Development ordinance and the Chicago Zoning Ordinance, this Planned Development shall control.

5. The following uses shall be permitted in this Planned Development: day care (subject to future Site Plan Approval); animal services (sales and grooming, veterinary, excluding kenneling and boarding); artist work or sales space; business equipment and sales; business support services (except day labor employment agency); eating and drinking establishments; financial services (all, excluding payday/title secured loan store and pawn shop); food and beverage retail sales (except as more specifically regulated); liquor sales (as accessory use); medical service; office; personal service (all); retail sales; participant sports and recreation (indoor); co-located wireless communication facilities; accessory parking; and accessory and incidental uses.
6. On-premises signs and temporary signs, such as construction and marketing signs, shall be permitted within the Planned Development, subject to the review and approval of the Department of Planning and Development. Off-premises signs are prohibited within the boundary of the Planned Development.

7. For purposes of height measurement, the definitions in the Chicago Zoning Ordinance shall apply. The height of any building shall also be subject to height limitations, if any, established by the Federal Aviation Administration.

8. The maximum permitted floor area ratio (FAR) for the Property shall be in accordance with the attached Bulk Regulations and Data Table. For the purpose of FAR calculations and measurements, the definitions in the Zoning Ordinance shall apply. The permitted FAR identified in the Bulk Regulations and Data Table has been determined using a net site area of 63,684 square feet and a base FAR of 5.0 and a Neighborhood Opportunity Bonus of 3.1 for a total FAR of 8.1.

9. Upon review and determination, Part II review, pursuant to Section 17-13-0610, a Part II review fee shall be assessed by the Department of Planning and Development. The fee, as determined by staff at the time, is final and binding on the Applicant and must be paid to the Department of Revenue prior to the issuance of any Part II approval.

10. The Site and Landscape Plans shall be in substantial conformance with the Landscape Ordinance and any other corresponding regulations and guidelines, including Section 17-13-0800. Final landscape plan review and approval will be by the Department of Planning and Development. Any interim reviews associated with site plan review or Part II reviews, are conditional until final Part II approval.

11. The Applicant shall comply with Rules and Regulations for the Maintenance of Stockpiles promulgated by the Commissioners of the Departments of Streets and Sanitation, Fleet and Facility Management and Buildings, under Section 13-32-085, or any other provision of the Municipal Code of Chicago.

12. The terms and conditions of development under this Planned Development ordinance may be modified administratively, pursuant to Section 17-13-0611-A, by the Zoning Administrator upon the application for such a modification by the Applicant, its successors and assigns and, if different than the Applicant, the legal titleholders and any ground lessors.

13. The Applicant acknowledges that it is in the public interest to design, construct and maintain the project in a manner which promotes, enables and maximizes universal access throughout the Property. Plans for all buildings and improvements on the Property shall be reviewed and approved by the Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations related to access for persons with disabilities and to promote the highest standard of accessibility.
14. The Applicant acknowledges that it is in the public interest to design, construct, renovate and maintain all buildings in a manner that provides healthier indoor environments, reduces operating costs and conserves energy and natural resources. The Applicant shall obtain the number of points necessary to meet the requirements of the Chicago Sustainable Development Policy, in effect at the time the Part II review process is initiated for each improvement that is subject to the aforementioned policy and must provide documentation verifying compliance.

15. The Applicant acknowledges that it is the policy of the City to maximize opportunities for Minority- and Women-owned Business Enterprises ("M/WBEs") and city residents to compete for contracts and jobs on construction projects approved through the planned development process. To assist the City in promoting and tracking such M/WBE and city resident participation, an applicant for planned development approval shall provide information at three points in the City approval process. First, the applicant must submit to DPD, as part of its application for planned development approval, an M/WBE Participation Proposal. The M/WBE Participation Proposal must identify the applicant's goals for participation of certified M/WBE firms in the design, engineering and construction of the project, and of city residents in the construction work. The City encourages goals of: (i) 26 percent MBE and 6 percent WBE participation (measured against the total construction budget for the project or any phase thereof), and (ii) 50 percent city resident hiring (measured against the total construction work hours for the project or any phase thereof). The M/WBE Participation Proposal must include a description of the applicant's proposed outreach plan designed to inform M/WBEs and city residents of job and contracting opportunities.

Second, at the time of the applicant's submission for Part II permit review for the project or any phase thereof, the applicant must submit to DPD: (a) updates (if any) to the applicant's preliminary outreach plan; (b) a description of the applicant's outreach efforts and evidence of such outreach, including, without limitation, copies of certified letters to M/WBE contractor associations and the ward office of the alderman in which the project is located and receipts thereof; (c) responses to the applicant's outreach efforts; and (d) updates (if any) to the applicant's M/WBE and city resident participation goals. Third, prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for the project or any phase thereof; the applicant must provide DPD with the actual level of M/WBE and city resident participation in the project or any phase thereof, and evidence of such participation. In addition to the foregoing, DPD may request such additional information as the department determines may be necessary or useful in evaluating the extent to which M/WBEs and city residents are informed of and utilized in planned development projects. All such information will be provided in a form acceptable to the Zoning Administrator. DPD will report the data it collects regarding projected and actual employment of M/WBEs and city residents in planned development projects twice yearly to the Chicago Plan Commission and annually to the Chicago City Council and the Mayor.

16. The Planned Development includes the property commonly known as 911 -- 925 West Fulton Market; 200 -- 212 North Peoria Street; 900 -- 924 West Lake Street; and
201 -- 233 North Sangamon Street, which is within a district designated as a Chicago Landmark. The plans for this Planned Development have been reviewed and approved by the Commission on Chicago Landmarks pursuant to the Chicago Landmarks Ordinance, Section 2-120-740.

Any variation in the plans for this Planned Development may be subject to the approval of Commission on Chicago Landmarks.

17. The Applicant acknowledges that the project has received a bonus FAR of 3.1, pursuant to Section 17-4-1000 of the Zoning Ordinance. With this bonus FAR, the total FAR for the Planned Development is 8.1. In exchange for the bonus FAR, the Applicant is required to make a corresponding payment, pursuant to Sections 17-4-1003-B and C, prior to the issuance of the first building permit for any building in the Planned Development; provided, however, if the Planned Development is constructed in phases, the bonus payment may be paid on a pro rata basis as the first building permit for each subsequent new building or phase of construction is issued. The bonus payment will be recalculated at the time of payment (including partial payments for phased developments) and may be adjusted based on changes in median land values in accordance with Section 17-4-1003C.3.

The bonus payment will be split between three separate funds, as follows: 80 percent to the Neighborhoods Opportunity Fund, 10 percent to the Citywide Adopt-a-Landmark Fund and 10 percent to the Local Impact Fund. In lieu of paying the City directly, the Department may: (a) direct developers to deposit a portion of the funds with a sister agency to finance specific local improvement projects; (b) direct developers to deposit a portion of the funds with a landmark property owner to finance specific landmark restoration projects; or (c) approve proposals for in-kind improvements to satisfy the Local Impact portion of the payment.

18. This Planned Development shall be governed by Section 17-13-0612. Should this Planned Development ordinance lapse, the Zoning Administrator shall initiate a zoning map amendment to rezone the Property to Planned Development 1510 as adopted by the Chicago City Council on July 21, 2021, and modified by any administrative relief granted subsequent to that date and prior to the adoption of this ordinance.

This plan of development consists of 19 Statements; a Bulk Regulations Table; an Existing Land-Use Map; an Existing Zoning Map; a Planned Development Boundary and Property Line; a Site Plan; a Site Plan (Phase I Interim Condition); a Podium Roof Plan; a Podium Roof Plan (Phase I Interim Condition); a Typical Plan; a Typical Plan (Phase I Interim Condition); a Landscape Plan; a Landscape Plan (Phase I Interim Condition); a Parkway Section; a Landscape Detail; Building Elevations (North, North (Phase I Interim Condition), West, West (Phase I Interim Condition), South, South (Phase I Interim Condition), East and East (Phase I Interim Condition)), and Facade Axon Details (Podium Levels, Parking and Upper Levels); prepared by KFP and Park Fowler Plus and dated January 16, 2025; and the ARO Profile Form submitted herein. In any instance where a provision of this Planned Development conflicts with the Chicago Building Code, the Building Code shall control. This Planned Development conforms to the intent and purpose of the Chicago Zoning Ordinance, and all requirements thereto, and satisfies the established criteria for approval as a Planned Development. In case of a conflict between the terms of this Planned Development ordinance and the Chicago Zoning Ordinance, this Planned Development shall control.

5. The following uses are permitted in the area delineated herein as a Planned Development: residential on and above the ground floor; office; lodging; animal services (excluding overnight boarding and kennels); business equipment sales and service; business support services; communication service establishments; eating and drinking establishments (all, including taverns); financial services (excluding payday loan and pawn shops); food and beverage retail sales; medical service; personal service; general retail sales; participant sports and recreation (excluding outdoor); artisan manufacturing, production and industrial services (only as an accessory use to a principal retail use); co-located wireless communication facilities, accessory parking and non-accessory parking (subject to Section 17-10-0503), and incidental and accessory uses.
6. On-premises signs and temporary signs, such as construction and marketing signs, shall be permitted within the Planned Development, subject to the review and approval of the Department of Planning and Development. Off-premises signs are prohibited within the boundary of the Planned Development.

7. For purposes of height measurement, the definitions in the Chicago Zoning Ordinance shall apply. The height of any building shall also be subject to height limitations, if any, established by the Federal Aviation Administration.

8. The maximum permitted floor area ratio (FAR) for the Property shall be in accordance with the attached Bulk Regulations and Data Table. For the purpose of FAR calculations and measurements, the definitions in the Zoning Ordinance shall apply. The permitted FAR identified in the Bulk Regulations and Data Table has been determined using a net site area of 74,692 square feet and a base FAR of 7.0.

The Applicant acknowledges that the project has received a bonus FAR of 4.5, pursuant to Section 17-4-1000 of the Zoning Ordinance. With this bonus FAR, the total FAR for the Planned Development is 11.5. In exchange for the bonus FAR, the Applicant is required to make a corresponding payment, pursuant to Sections 17-4-1003-B and C, prior to the issuance of the first building permit for any building in the Planned Development; provided, however, if the Planned Development is constructed in phases, the bonus payment may be paid on a pro rata basis as the first building permit for each subsequent new building or phase of construction is issued. The bonus payment will be recalculated at the time of payment (including partial payments for phased developments) and may be adjusted based on changes in median land values in accordance with Section 17-4-1003-C.3.

The bonus payment will be split between three separate funds, as follows: 80 percent to the Neighborhoods Opportunity Fund, 10 percent to the Citywide Adopt-a-Landmark Fund and 10 percent to the Local Impact Fund. In lieu of paying the City directly, the Department may: (a) direct developers to deposit a portion of the funds with a sister agency to finance specific local improvement projects; (b) direct developers to deposit a portion of the funds with a landmark property owner to finance specific landmark restoration projects; or (c) approve proposals for in-kind improvements to satisfy the Local Impact portion of the payment.

9. Upon review and determination, Part II review, pursuant to Section 17-13-0610, a Part II review fee shall be assessed by the Department of Planning and Development. The fee, as determined by staff at the time, is final and binding on the Applicant and must be paid to the Department of Revenue prior to the issuance of any Part II approval.

10. The Site and Landscape Plans shall be in substantial conformance with the Landscape Ordinance and any other corresponding regulations and guidelines, including Section 17-13-0800. Final landscape plan review and approval will be by the Department of Planning and Development. Any interim reviews associated with site plan review or Part II reviews, are conditional until final Part II approval.
If construction of Phase 2 of the P.D. has not commenced within one year of issuance of the final certificate of occupancy for the principal building located in Phase 1 of the P.D., the Applicant shall cause a mural to be painted on the west facade of the podium of the principal building located in Phase 1, as noted on the West Elevation exhibit.

11. The Applicant shall comply with Rules and Regulations for the Maintenance of Stockpiles promulgated by the Commissioners of the Departments of Streets and Sanitation, Fleet and Facility Management and Buildings, under Section 13-32-085, or any other provision of the Municipal Code of Chicago.

12. The terms and conditions of development under this Planned Development ordinance may be modified administratively, pursuant to Section 17-13-0611-A, by the Zoning Administrator upon the application for such a modification by the Applicant, its successors and assigns and, if different than the Applicant, the legal titleholders and any ground lessors.

13. The Applicant acknowledges that it is in the public interest to design, construct and maintain the project in a manner which promotes, enables and maximizes universal access throughout the Property. Plans for all buildings and improvements on the Property shall be reviewed and approved by the Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations related to access for persons with disabilities and to promote the highest standard of accessibility.

14. The Applicant acknowledges that it is in the public interest to design, construct, renovate and maintain all buildings in a manner that provides healthier indoor environments, reduces operating costs and conserves energy and natural resources. The Applicant shall obtain the number of points necessary to meet the requirements of the Chicago Sustainable Development Policy, in effect at the time the Part II review process is initiated for each improvement that is subject to the aforementioned Policy and must provide documentation verifying compliance.

15. Except with respect to Subarea A, prior to the Part II approval (Section 17-13-0610 of the Chicago Zoning Ordinance) for any buildings, the Applicant shall submit a site plan, landscape plan and building elevations (a "Site Plan Submittal") for the specific subarea(s) or portion of specific subarea(s) for review and approval by DPD (each, a "Site Plan Approval"). Review and approval by DPD is intended to assure that specific development components substantially conform with the Planned Development and to assist the City in monitoring ongoing development. Site Plan Submittals (Section 17-13-0800) need only include that portion of the Property for which approval is being sought by the Applicant. If the Applicant is seeking approval for a portion of the Property that represents less than an entire subarea, only a Site Plan Submittal for such portion of the Property shall be required.

Provided the Site Plan Submittal required hereunder is in general conformance with this Planned Development and the Design Guidelines, and provided Applicant has
timely provided all Site Plan Submittals, the Commissioner shall issue such Site Plan Approval and the Plan Commission shall conduct its review hearing of the Site Plan Submittal. Following approval by DPD, the approved Site Plan Approval, supporting data and materials shall be made part of the main file and shall be deemed to be an integral part of the P.O.

After Site Plan Approval, changes or modifications may be made pursuant to the provisions of Statement 12. In the event of any inconsistency between approved plans and the terms of the P.O., the terms of the P.O. shall govern. Any Site Plan Submittal shall, at a minimum, provide the following information:

a. the boundaries of the property and a site plan identifying the proximity to public transit;

b. the footprint of the improvements;

c. location and dimensions of all parking spaces and loading berths;

d. preliminary landscaping plan prepared by a landscape architect;

e. all pedestrian circulation routes;

f. the location of any adjacent public improvements;

g. preliminary building sections and elevations of the improvements with a preliminary building materials list; and

h. statistical information applicable to the property limited to the following:

(1) floor area and floor area ratio;

(2) uses to be established;

(3) building heights;

(4) all setbacks, required and provided;

(5) floor area devoted to all uses (e.g. office, retail etc.);

(6) number of dwelling units (if applicable);

(7) number of parking spaces;

(8) number of loading spaces/berths;

(9) a School Impact Study (if residential); and
an approved Site Plan by CDOT (as provided in Statement 3), Fire
Prevention Bureau, Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities, and the
Building Department's Division of Stormwater Management.

Site Plan Submittals shall include all other information necessary to illustrate
substantial conformance to the P.O. and Design Guidelines

16. The Applicant acknowledges that it is the policy of the City to maximize opportunities
for Minority- and Women-owned Business Enterprises ("M/WBEs") and city residents
to compete for contracts and jobs on construction projects approved through the
planned development process. To assist the City in promoting and tracking such
M/WBE and city resident participation, an applicant for planned development approval
shall provide information at three points in the city approval process. First, the
applicant must submit to DPD, as part of its application for planned development
approval, an M/WBE Participation Proposal. The M/WBE Participation Proposal must
identify the applicant's goals for participation of certified M/WBE firms in the design,
engineering and construction of the project, and of city residents in the construction
work. The city encourages goals of 26 percent MBE and 6 percent WBE participation
(measured against the total construction budget for the project or any phase thereof),
and (ii)* 50 percent city resident hiring (measured against the total construction work
hours for the project or any phase thereof). The M/WBE Participation Proposal must
include a description of the applicant's proposed outreach plan designed to inform
M/WBEs and city residents of job and contracting opportunities. Second, at the time
of the applicant's submission for Part II permit review for the project or any phase
thereof, the applicant must submit to DPD: (a) updates (if any) to the applicant's
preliminary outreach plan; (b) a description of the applicant's outreach efforts and
evidence of such outreach, including, without limitation, copies of certified letters to
M/WBE contractor associations and the ward office of the alderman in which the
project is located and receipts thereof; (c) responses to the applicant's outreach
efforts; and (d) updates (if any) to the applicant's M/WBE and city resident participation
goals. Third, prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for the project or any
phase thereof, the applicant must provide DPD with the actual level of M/WBE and city
resident participation in the project or any phase thereof, and evidence of such
participation. In addition to the foregoing, DPD may request such additional
information as the department determines may be necessary or useful in evaluating
the extent to which M/WBEs and city residents are informed of and utilized in planned
development projects. All such information will be provided in a form acceptable to the
Zoning Administrator. DPD will report the data it collects regarding projected and
actual employment of M/WBEs and city residents in planned development projects
twice yearly to the Chicago Plan Commission and annually to the Chicago City Council
and the Mayor.

17. The Applicant acknowledges and agrees that the rezoning of the Property from an M2-3 Light Industry District to the DX-7 Downtown Mixed-Use District and then to this Residential-Business Planned Development ("P.D.") is an "entitlement" that triggers the requirements of Section 2-44-085 of the Municipal Code of Chicago (the "ARO"). The P.D. is located in a "downtown district" within the meaning of the ARO and permits the construction of 240 dwelling units in three subareas: 80 in Subarea A, 50 in Subarea B, and 110 in Subarea C (the "Project"). The Applicant intends to construct owner-occupied units.

Developers of owner-occupied projects in downtown districts must provide between 16 percent and 20 percent of the units in the residential development as affordable units, depending on the average depth of affordability as described in subsection (F)(3) of the ARO, and may satisfy their affordable housing obligation through: (a) the establishment of on-site or off-site affordable units; (b) payment of a fee in lieu of the establishment of on-site or off-site affordable units; or (c) any combination thereof; provided, however, if the developer elects not to provide at least 25 percent of the required affordable units on-site, the in lieu fee amount per unit shall increase by 25 percent (the "Premium Fee").

The Applicant has elected the 20 percent option as set forth in the chart in subsection (F)(3) of the ARO. As a result, the Applicant's affordable housing obligation is 48 (20 percent of 240). The Applicant has agreed to satisfy its affordable housing obligation by making a cash payment to the City's Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund in the amount of $13,048,920 (48 x the Premium Fee of $271,852.50 per unit), as adjusted in accordance with the ARO (the "Cash Payment"). It is hereby agreed that 50 percent of the Cash Payment (the "Gap Funds") shall be released from the Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund to a developer of an affordable housing project in the 27th Ward, as identified by DOH in consultation with the local Alderperson (the "Affordable Project"), to fill a gap in the Affordable Project's financing. DOH shall deposit the Gap Funds in escrow at the closing of the construction financing for the Affordable Project, provided the Affordable Project is subject to requirements and regulations pertaining to affordability that are stricter than the ARO requires.

If, following the passage of this P.D., the Applicant requests any material change to its method of compliance with the ARO, such as electing to locate affordable units on-site or off-site or changing the target affordability level, or chooses to decrease the number of dwelling units in the Project, after the passage of this P.D., DOH may adjust the AHP as requested, in accordance with the ARO, without amending this P.D., provided however, the Applicant must update and resubmit the revised AHP form to DOH for review and approval and, at DOH's request, provide an informational presentation to the Plan Commission regarding such change. Prior to the issuance of any building permits for any residential building in the Project, including, without limitation, excavation or foundation permits, the Applicant must make the Cash Payment to the City for deposit in the Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund. The Commissioner of DOH may enforce remedies for any breach of this Statement, and enter into settlement agreements with respect to any such breach, subject to the approval of the Corporation Counsel, without amending the P.D.
This statement does not include all ARO requirements and options. It is intended to provide an overview of the application of the ARO to this P.D. In the event of any conflict between this statement and the terms and conditions of the ARO, the ARO shall govern.

18. The Applicant acknowledges that the Property is located in the Kinzie Industrial Corridor Conversion Area and has undergone a "rezoning" within the meaning of Chapter 16-8 of the Municipal Code (the "Industrial Corridor System Fund Ordinance"). As a result of this rezoning, the Planned Development is subject to the conversion fee provisions of the Industrial Corridor System Fund Ordinance. The purpose of the conversion fee is to mitigate the loss of industrial land and facilities in conversion areas by generating funds for investment in receiving industrial corridors in order to preserve and enhance the City's industrial base, support new and expanding industrial uses, and ensure a stable future for manufacturing and industrial employment in Chicago. The Applicant is required to pay the conversion fee in full prior to the issuance of the first building permit for any building in the Planned Development; provided, however, if the Planned Development is constructed in phases, the conversion fee may be paid on a pro rata basis as the first building permit for each subsequent new building or phase of construction is issued. The amount of the conversion fee due prior to the issuance of a building permit shall be calculated based on the fee rate in effect at the time of payment.

19. This Planned Development shall be governed by Section 17-13-0612. Should this Planned Development ordinance lapse, the Commissioner of the Department of Planning and Development shall initiate a zoning map amendment to rezone the Property to the DX-7 Downtown Mixed-Use District.

NARRATIVE AND PLANS FOR TYPE 1 ZONING AMENDMENT FOR
1243 WEST OHIO ST., CHICAGO

The subject property is currently improved with a residential condominium building with two

and floor area requirements of the RM4.5 Residential Multi-Unit District to build 1st floor
addition (286 SF) to unit 1 with partial interior alterations (basement & 1st floor), to convert
existing 2nd floor balcony to new roof top deck for unit 2 & to add a new garage rooftop deck,
accessed from the rear deck and stairs; existing density with 2 DU to remain; existing 2 parking
spaces to remain; existing height 39'-6" / no change proposed. The Applicants are also applying
as a Type 1 Map Amendment with optional relief sought pursuant to 17-13-0303-D for setbacks
and open space requirements.

I. Optional Relief for Adjustment and Variation under Section 17-13-0303-D – a Type 1 map amendment pursuant to Section 17-13-0300, may include relief available pursuant to Section 17-13-1000 or 17-13-1100; in such instances, City Council approval of a Type-1 application containing said elements shall preclude subsequent review otherwise required pursuant to Sections 17-13-1000 or 17-13-1100, provided that no Type 1 application permits issued may be in violation of Section 17-13-0310:

(A) The Applicant also seeks relief for variations under section 17-13-1101-B, from rear setback requirements of Section 17-2-0306-C – to reduce the required rear setback from 30 feet required to 0 feet proposed; from side setback requirements of Section 17-2-0309 – to reduce the required side setbacks from 4.8’ combined total with neither required setback less than 2 feet to the existing 2.88’ combined with 0’ on the east side and 2.88’ on the west side; and variation from the rear yard open space requirements of Section 17-2-0307 to reduce the required rear yard open space from 156 square feet to zero.

(B) In support of this request, the Applicant states the following:

1. Strict compliance with the regulations and standards of this Zoning Ordinance would create practical difficulties and hardships for the subject property, since the subject property is a substandard lot and already improved with an existing non-conforming residential building, so no additional floor area can be added without these variations.

2. The requested variations are further consistent with the stated purpose and intent of this Zoning Ordinance since this proposed addition and corresponding variations relief are compatible with the existing land use pattern within the subject neighborhood.

3. Evidence of the Practical Difficulties or Particular Hardship is as follows:
   - The practical difficulties and particular hardships are due to unique circumstances and are not generally applicable to other similarly situated properties. The property is a narrow lot with only 24’ of lot frontage, and only 100 feet of lot depth, which also impacts the ability to comply with the current setback requirements.
   - These proposed variations merely preserve the status quo at the property and maintain the existing setbacks.
   - As such, these variations will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood.

- During future site plan approval for phases 2-6, protected bike lanes will be required to connect new bike lanes to existing bike lanes. It may also be determined that bike lanes are required in both the north and south directions or the east and west directions to provide a proper connection. These bicycle network connections will be determined by CDOT.

Any unique pavement, street furniture, light poles, decorations, bollards, or any other element that is not a standard CDOT installation shall be the responsibility of the property owner. This includes regular maintenance and repairs. Removable bollards adjacent to driveways identified on site plan must be kept in place unless vehicles are utilizing the driveways for loading into or out of the property.

Street cross sections are conceptual and will be finalized through site plan review in each phase of development. Minimum 9’6” feet sidewalk shall be incorporated into all future design.

On each side, the signs may contain an electronic changeable message board and four ad panels each measuring no more than four feet (4') high by twenty-five feet (25') wide. In addition, two building-mounted signs identifying the stadium, which signs shall not exceed the dimensions of eight feet (8') by one hundred eighty feet (180'), with or without electronic, changeable message boards, shall be permitted. All other advertising signs shall be restricted to the interior of the stadium structure, unless approved by the Department of Planning.
Future and additional on-Premise signs and temporary signs, such as construction and marketing signs, shall be permitted within the Planned Development, subject to the review and approval of the Department of Planning and Development. Off-Premise signs are prohibited within the boundary of the Planned Development; provided, however, for the purposes of this Planned Development, any sign which identifies the name or sponsorship of any structure or designated area within the Property, or any sponsor of the teams operating in the Property, or any sponsor of a retail showcase, recreation area or other space within the Property shall be deemed an on-premises sign and may be located in any subarea. For purposes of Section 17-12-0711, the principal use of the Planned Development is a sports stadium. At the Applicant’s election, the maximum total sign area and a Uniform Sign Plan may be reviewed and approved by DPD pursuant to Section 17-13-0611-A and 17-13-0800. Interior signs are permitted and nothing in this Planned Development shall regulate any interior sign.

7. For purposes of height measurement, the definitions in the Chicago Zoning Ordinance shall apply. The height of any building shall also be subject to height limitations, if any, established by the Federal Aviation Administration.

8. The maximum permitted floor area ratio (FAR) for the Property shall be in accordance with the attached Bulk Regulations and Data Table. For the purpose of FAR calculations and measurements, the definitions in the Zoning Ordinance shall apply. The permitted FAR identified in the Bulk Regulations and Data Table has been determined using a net site area of 2,506,788 square feet and a base FAR of 5.0.

9. Upon review and determination, Part II Review, pursuant to Section 17-13-0610, a Part II Review Fee shall be assessed by DPD. The fee, as determined by staff at the time, is final and binding on the Applicant and must be paid to the Department of Revenue prior to the issuance of any Part II approval.

10. All Site & Landscapes Plan shall be in substantial conformance with the Landscape Ordinance and any other corresponding regulations and guidelines, including Section 17-13-0800. Final landscape plan review and approval will be by DPD. Any interim reviews associated with site plan review or Part II reviews are conditional until final Part II approval.

11. The Applicant shall comply with Rules and Regulations for the Maintenance of Stockpiles promulgated by the Commissioners of the Departments of Streets and Sanitation, Fleet and Facility Management and Buildings, under Section 13-32-085, or any other provision of the Municipal Code of Chicago.

12. The terms and conditions of development under this Planned Development ordinance including, without limitations, modifications to the exhibits and design guidelines, may be modified administratively, pursuant to Section 17-13-0611-A, by the Zoning Administrator upon the application for such a modification by the Applicant, its successors and assigns and,
if different than the Applicant, the legal title holders and any ground lessors. It is hereby acknowledged that many of elements of the exhibits and design guidelines including, but not limited to, sections and access, circulation and open space plans, are illustrative and may change as the Property is developed. Such modifications shall be permitted if approved by the Zoning Administrator pursuant to Section 17-13-0611-A.

13. The Applicant acknowledges that it is in the public interest to design, construct and maintain the project in a manner which promotes, enables and maximizes universal access throughout the Property. Plans for all buildings and improvements on the Property shall be reviewed and approved by the Mayor’s Office for People with Disabilities to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations related to access for persons with disabilities and to promote the highest standard of accessibility.

14. The Applicant acknowledges that it is in the public interest to design, construct, renovate and maintain all buildings in a manner that provides healthier indoor environments, reduces operating costs and conserves energy and natural resources. The Applicant shall obtain the number of points necessary to meet the requirements of the Chicago Sustainable Development Policy, in effect at the time the Part II review process is initiated for each improvement that is subject to the aforementioned Policy and must provide documentation verifying compliance.

15. Except with respect to Phase 1 (Subarea A), prior to the Part II Approval (Section 17-13-0610 of the Chicago Zoning Ordinance) for any buildings, the Applicant shall submit a site plan, landscape plan and building elevations (a “Site Plan Submittal”) for the specific Sub-Area(s) or portion of specific Sub-Area(s) for review and approval by DPD (each, a “Site Plan Approval”). Review and approval by DPD is intended to assure that specific development components substantially conform with the Planned Development and to assist the City in monitoring ongoing development. Site Plan Submittals (Section 17-13-0800) need only include that portion of the Property for which approval is being sought by the Applicant. If the Applicant is seeking approval for a portion of the Property that represents less than an entire Sub-Area, only a Site Plan Submittal for such portion of the Property shall be required.

No Part II approval for which a Site Plan is required hereunder shall be granted until the Site Plan Submittal has been approved by the Commissioner of the Department of Planning and Development and reviewed by the Chicago Plan Commission at a public hearing. The hearing conducted by the Plan Commission shall be for review purposes only and no approval or recommendation shall be required in order for the Commissioner to issue an approval of the Site Plan Submittal. Provided the Site Plan Submittal required hereunder is in general conformance with this Planned Development and the Design Guidelines, and provided Applicant has timely provided all Site Plan Submittals, the Commissioner shall issue such site plan decision after the Plan Commission conducts its review hearing. Following approval by DPD, the approved Site Plan Approval, supporting data and materials shall be made part of the main file and shall be deemed to be an integral part of the PD.
After Site Plan Approval, changes or modifications may be made pursuant to the provisions of Statement 12. In the event of any inconsistency between approved plans and the terms of the PD, the terms of the PD shall govern. Any Site Plan Submittal shall, at a minimum, provide the following information:

a. the boundaries of the property and a site plan identifying the proximity to public transit;

b. the footprint of the improvements;

c. location and dimensions of all parking spaces and loading berths;

d. preliminary landscaping plan prepared by a landscape architect;

e. all pedestrian circulation routes;

f. the location of any adjacent public improvements;

g. preliminary building sections and elevations of the improvements with a preliminary building materials list; and

h. any statistical information applicable to the property, including but not limited to:

(1) floor area and floor area ratio;

(2) uses to be established;

(3) building heights;

(4) all setbacks, required and provided;

(5) floor area devoted to all uses (e.g. office, retail etc.);

(6) number of dwelling units (if applicable);

(7) number of parking spaces;

(8) number of loading spaces/berths;

(9) a School Impact Study (if residential); and

(10) an approved Site Plan by CDOT, including any required vacations and dedications (as provided in Statement 3), Fire Prevention Bureau, Mayor's
Office for People with Disabilities, and the Building Departments Division of Stormwater Management.

Site Plan Submittals shall include all other information necessary to illustrate substantial conformance to the PD and Design Guidelines.

16. Subject in all cases to the other statements, terms, regulations and provisions of this Planned Development, the Applicant shall have the right to designate additional subareas within the Planned Development from time to time in order to promote orderly development, to facilitate financing, acquisition, leasing or disposition of the Property or relevant portions thereof, to designate zoning control or to otherwise administer this Planned Development. The designation and re-designation of subareas shall not in and of itself require an amendment to this Planned Development and shall be approved as a minor change, pursuant to Section 17-13-0611; included in such minor change, the Applicant shall provide notice of all material terms of any such designation to DPD, including the designated area and the bulk regulations that will apply therein, for DPD's administrative purposes to facilitate Part II review for any such designated subarea. In furtherance of the foregoing, and in all cases subject to the other statements, terms, regulations and provisions of this Planned Development, the Applicant may allocate or assign previously unused development rights under the Planned Development from other designated or to be designated subareas including, but not limited to, floor area and floor area ratio, signage, building height, dwelling units and parking; provided, however, that the overall regulations and limitations set forth in the Bulk Regulations and Data Table and the Plans applicable to the entirety of the Planned Development shall not be exceeded or increased as a result of any such allocation(s) or assignment(s), and (iii) all such allocation(s) or assignment(s) of development rights are subject to the terms of Section 17-13-0611 and the Design Guidelines of this Planned Development.

The Applicant may continue to evolve the design of the building elevations or materials for the South Garage and Hotel located in Subarea A and changes to such elevations or materials, if any, shall, if mutually agreed upon, be reviewed and approved by DPD pursuant to Section 17-13-0800.

17. The Applicant acknowledges and agrees that the rezoning of the Property from Stadium Planned Development No. 522, to Stadium Residential-Business Planned Development No. 522, as amended ("PD") is an "entitlement" that triggers the requirements of Section 2-44-085 of the Municipal Code of Chicago (the "ARO"). The PD is located in a community preservation area within the meaning of the ARO and permits the construction of 9,463 dwelling units.

Developers of projects in community preservation areas with 30 or more units must provide between 10% and 20% of the units in the residential development as affordable units, depending on the average depth of affordability provided, as described in subsection (F)(2) of the ARO. Regardless of the applicable percentage of affordable units in the rental project,
developers must construct at least 25% of the affordable units on-site and another 25% on-site or off-site (collectively, the “Required Units”), and may satisfy the balance of their affordable housing obligation through: (a) the establishment of additional on-site or off-site affordable units; (b) payment of a fee in lieu of the establishment of on-site or off-site affordable units; or (c) any combination thereof. All on-site affordable units must be accessible dwelling units, as required under subsection (W)(10) of the ARO, and developers must give preference in leasing accessible units to people with disabilities. All off-site affordable units must have at least two bedrooms and must be located in a downtown district, inclusionary housing area, or community preservation area. Whether on-site or off-site, developers must give preference in leasing affordable units of two bedrooms or more to multi-person households, as specified in the ARO rules. If a residential project is located in a transit-served location, off-site units must be located in a substantially comparable transit-served location.

The Applicant has elected the 20% option as set forth in the chart in subsection (F)(2) of the ARO. As a result, the Applicant’s affordable housing obligation is 1,893 affordable units (20% of 9,463 = 1,892.6, rounded up pursuant to subsection (T) of the ARO), half of which are Required Units. The Applicant has agreed to satisfy its affordable housing obligation by providing all 1,893 affordable units in the buildings in the PD, as set forth in the Affordable Housing Profile (AHP) form attached hereto. The Applicant agrees that the affordable rental units must be affordable to households with a range of incomes averaging 60% of the Chicago Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area Median Income (AMI), as updated annually, provided that (x) the maximum income level for any affordable unit may not exceed 80% of the AMI, (y) at least one-third (or 631 units) must be affordable to households at or below 50% of the AMI, of which one-sixth (or 105 of the 631 units) must be affordable to households at or below 40% of the AMI, and (z) all income levels must be multiples of 10% of the AMI.

If the Applicant requests any material change to its method of compliance with the ARO, such as locating affordable units off-site instead of on-site or changing the target affordability level after the passage of this PD, DOH may adjust the AHP form as requested, in accordance with the ARO, without amending the PD, provided however, the Applicant must update and resubmit the revised AHP form to DOH for review and approval and, at DOH’s request, provide an informational presentation to the Plan Commission on such change. Prior to the issuance of any building permits for any residential building in the PD, including, without limitation, excavation or foundation permits, the Applicant must execute and record an Inclusionary Housing Agreement (“IHA”) in accordance with subsection (N) of the ARO. The terms of the IHA and any amendments thereto are incorporated herein by this reference. The Applicant acknowledges and agrees that the IHA will be recorded against the PD, and will constitute a lien against such property. The Commissioner of DOH may enforce remedies for any breach of this Statement 17, including any breach of the IHA, and enter into settlement agreements with respect to any such breach, subject to the approval of the Corporation Counsel, without amending the PD.
This statement does not include all ARO requirements and options. It is intended to provide an overview of the application of the ARO to this PD. In the event of any conflict between this statement and the terms and conditions of the ARO, the ARO shall govern.

18. Subject to the receipt of all necessary permits and approvals, the Applicant or its successors and assigns, at its sole cost, shall design and construct the open space improvements in shown on the Open Space Plan (hereinafter the “Park”). Upon completion of the Park, the Applicant, its successors and assigns and, if different than the Applicant, the legal title holders and any ground lessors, shall be responsible for maintaining and managing the Park for the purposes set forth herein, including ensuring that the Park’s landscaping is well maintained, that the vegetation and plantings are kept in a healthy condition and that the Park facilities are clean, well lit, litter free and clear of snow (hardscaped areas) and debris. The Applicant shall provide sufficient liability insurance coverage for the operation of the Park for public use. The Applicant shall provide informational and wayfinding signage at all entries that the Park is open to the public (subject to occasional partial closure for private use provided that a path providing access during such closures shall be maintained through the Park), free of charge, during normal park hours from 6:00am to 11:00pm every day of the year. During winter months, the Applicant may enclose portions of the Park in a temporary climate-controlled manner with access managed in accordance and compliance with the Chicago Park District Code. The maintenance and management obligations contained herein shall continue for the life of this Planned Development.

Park improvements within each Subarea shall be constructed and delivered prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the vertical improvements within such Subarea provided, however, Park improvements may be provided in an interim condition (i) until receipt of the certificate of occupancy for the final principal building in each subarea or delayed if consistent with good landscape practice, but not longer than one year following the timing for construction of the final open space improvements set forth herein, or (ii) if necessary to accommodate the later construction of large park recreation components.

Prior to issuance of building permits for the first principal building for the Planned Development, the Applicant will enter into a development and maintenance agreement (the “DEMA”) with the City for the construction, maintenance, and management of the Park. The DEMA obligations shall be binding upon the Applicant, its successors and assigns, including but not limited to a homeowners or master association whose purpose includes maintaining the Park. Upon completion of the Park, the public access provided for herein shall be memorialized in a public access easement agreement (which may be included in the DEMA) with and for the benefit of the City. The recording and other costs associated with establishing the easement shall be the responsibility of the Applicant. A copy of said public access easement agreement shall be on file with DPD.
The Commissioner is hereby authorized to enter into the DEMA (or more than one DEMA if the Commissioner deems necessary depending on the phasing of the development) and all other documents contemplated by the Statement and, in his/her sole discretion, may modify by minor change the foregoing requirements, without further City Council approval, for the DEMA(s) and public access easement agreement(s) so as to permit alternate forms of achieving compliance with the Applicant's construction, maintenance and management obligations and public access rights, such as, by means of example and not limitation, one or more restrictive covenants or owners' reciprocal easement and operation agreements in form and substance acceptable to the City which expressly grant the City necessary enforcement, self-help and lien rights as may be necessary to assure compliance with this Statement.

19. The Applicant acknowledges that it is the policy of the City to maximize opportunities for Minority and Women-owned Business Enterprises ("M/WBEs") and city residents to compete for contracts and jobs on construction projects approved through the planned development process. To assist the City in promoting and tracking such M/WBE and city resident participation, an applicant for planned development approval shall provide information at three points in the City approval process. First, the applicant must submit to DPD, as part of its application for planned development approval, an M/WBE Participation Proposal. The M/WBE Participation Proposal must identify the Applicant's goals for participation of certified M/WBE firms in the design, engineering and construction of the project, and of city residents in the construction work. The City encourages goals of (i) 26% MBE and 6% WBE participation (measured against the total construction budget for the project or any phase thereof), and (ii) 50% city resident hiring (measured against the total construction work hours for the project or any phase thereof). Notwithstanding the City's goals, the Applicant has established goals of 30% MBE and 8% WBE participation. The M/WBE Participation Proposal must include a description of the Applicant's proposed outreach plan designed to inform M/WBEs and city residents of job and contracting opportunities. Second, at the time of the Applicant's submission for Part II permit review for the project or any phase thereof, the Applicant must submit to DPD (a) updates (if any) to the Applicant's preliminary outreach plan, (b) a description of the Applicant's outreach efforts and evidence of such outreach, including, without limitation, copies of certified letters to M/WBE contractor associations and the ward office of the alderman in which the project is located and receipts thereof; (c) responses to the Applicant's outreach efforts, and (d) updates (if any) to the applicant's M/WBE and city resident participation goals. Third, prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for the project or any phase thereof, the Applicant must provide DPD with the actual level of M/WBE and city resident participation in the project or any phase thereof, and evidence of such participation. In addition to the forgoing, DPD may request such additional information as DPD determines may be necessary or useful in evaluating the extent to which M/WBEs and city residents are informed of and utilized in planned development projects. All such information will be provided in a form acceptable to the Zoning Administrator. DPD will report the data it collects regarding projected and actual employment of M/WBEs and city
residents in planned development projects twice yearly to the Chicago Plan Commission and annually to the Chicago City Council and the Mayor.

20. Construction of the improvements contemplated by this Planned Development may be completed in phases over a period of years. It is acknowledged that commencement and completion of certain phases may exceed the periods set forth in Section 17-13-0612 of the Chicago Zoning Ordinance as of the date of this approval. Should this Planned Development ordinance lapse, the Commissioner may initiate a Zoning Map Amendment to rezone the property to C2-5 Neighborhood Commercial District.

Neighborhood Design Guidelines

1. Introduction
   a. Purpose

   All development within PDS22 must comply to all applicable plans and guidelines adopted by the City Plan Commission.

   The guidelines in this document provide additional standards for buildings and public realm design. These guidelines should set the foundation for all future development to advance cohesion throughout the development, while also providing space for creativity and contrast.

   Overall, PDS22 design should aim to promote equity, inclusion, and sustainability, furthering the city’s commitment to creating a better future for all its residents.

2. Public Realm Guidelines
   a. Public Realm and Open Space Framework

   Reintroducing ecological and programmatic diversity into the existing bare parking lots surrounding the United Center, the landscape should work with the newly activated retail and amenity spaces to activate the surrounding spaces. Landscape shall be the glue between the new architecture, existing roadways and cultural touchpoints creating a unified public realm that allows for diversity in program and scales regardless of season, time of day or event.

   1. Safety is a top priority. Well-lit pathways, visible security measures, and regular maintenance should be adhered to.

   2. Open space should include lush greenery, well-maintained lawns, and a diverse array of trees and plants.

   3. Wayfinding shall match neighborhood-wide branding and shall be strategically placed throughout to guide visitors and residents.

   4. Elevated open spaces should capitalize on wide-ranging views of the downtown Chicago skyline and maximizing outdoor space that can be utilized throughout all four seasons. Accessible ramps and walkways shall connect the ground floor to the elevated roof decks providing all with a variety of active and passive park spaces for any occasion.

   5. A variety of scales and activation shall offer opportunities for community gathering, recreation, play, art, ecological restoration and active urban life. Gathering spaces, such as plazas, amphitheaters, and recreational lawns, shall be incorporated throughout, allowing residents to socialize, celebrate, and be active outdoors.

   6. Lighting design in park and plazas shall be designed to avoid light pollution to the surrounding neighborhoods.

   b. Hardscaped Open Space

   The goal of the neighborhood is to create open space in all subareas. Hardscaped areas should be another opportunity for an active ground plane, unifying the neighborhood. Hardscaped
areas should adhere to the following requirements:
1. Hardscape shall promote outdoor leisure and connection, including spaces for sitting, walking, and eating.
2. Hardscape materials shall vary to create interest and culture.
3. Space for public art should be maintained in public plazas.
4. Lighting design in the plazas shall be designed to avoid light pollution to the surrounding building and neighborhoods.

c. Street Design and Streetscapes

The neighborhood’s streetscape design will unify the pedestrian realm across all the districts into a cohesive and safe environment.
1. Sidewalk widths shall adjust across the district to accommodate the program at the podium level but shall maintain at least 9’-6” depth. Other sidewalks, where possible, can be increased to over 20’ to allow for a designated pedestrian zone in addition to a healthy retail area for sidewalk dining.
2. In nearly all conditions, a 3’-4’ planting buffer should separate the pedestrian zone from vehicles and incorporate various streetscape elements such as benches, bike racks, signage, and trash cans.

3. Ground Floor Guidelines

a. Street Level Activation

The goal of the neighborhood is to promote an active street level.
1. Ground plan should be pedestrianized, with food & beverage, retail, and open space
   a. activation, whenever possible.
2. Avoid long non-activated walls.
3. Entrances to buildings should be obvious and visible, with unique storefronts to create character.
4. Buildings should extent to the street, while maintaining an appropriate sidewalk width, to create an urban experience.

b. Service and Parking

The goals of the service and parking design should help meet the goals of the building loading and servicing requirements, while blending into the urban environment as much as possible.
1. Access to and egress from the inner ring parking garages should be separate.
2. Service access for the United Center shall remain on Damen.
3. Service entrances should blend in as much as possible with the surrounding building façade.
4. Alleys for garbage collection should be included as much as possible.
4. Built Form Guidelines
   a. Base Building/Podium

   When building the neighborhood, human scale should be at the forefront of all design.
   1. Base building podium heights shall be kept low, from 2-4 stories.
   2. Podiums should promote the street level activation described in the “street level
      activation” section
   3. Entrances to the base building should be obvious
   4. Retail should have personality while maintaining high quality facades
   5. Signage should meet the signage requirements for the neighborhood
   6. Bird-friendly design should be considered

   b. Height and Massing

   Residents often form deep emotional connections with their city’s skyline, viewing it as a
   symbol of identity and pride. Chicago’s iconic skyline is recognizable around the world, and the
   United Center neighborhood will add to that legacy.
   1. Taller buildings shall be placed towards the east, closest to the growth in Fulton
      Market, stepping down in height towards the residential context to the west.
   2. Taller buildings will frame the views from the lower rise buildings on the west over the
      United Center arena.
   3. Building heights shall vary to create a layered, contextual urban landscape.
   4. The buildings’ forms should be shaped to maximize downtown views while also
      prioritizing quality sunlight, allowing smaller buildings exposure throughout the day. In
      addition, the height of the smaller buildings to the west should respond to the overall
      context of the neighborhood.
   5. Conceal mechanical systems from pedestrian views using materials that are cohesive to
      the overall building.
   6. Balconies shall be integrated into building façade design.
   7. Taller buildings, over 4 stories, should step back after the podium to emphasize
      human scale.

   c. Material Guidelines for Buildings

   The United Center neighborhood vision seeks to integrate Chicago’s rich material history to
   ensure that the new architecture has a strong sense of place while providing a new urban vision
   for the future of the West Side.
   1. Buildings across the new district should utilize primarily brick cladding at podiums to
      maintain a cohesive streetscape expression.
   2. The mid-rise and high-rise buildings above shall have more flexibility in expression but
      should still reference Chicago’s rich history of materials for a cohesive material palette
      across the area.
   3. Materials should be high-quality and durable.
   4. Finishes should reinforce the character zone identity.
5. In subarea D and E, opportunities exist for iconic buildings to serve as feature architectural elements, providing forward thinking dynamism that help distinguish the new neighborhood amidst the city’s skyline.

d. Building Performance

Buildings shall meet the sustainability requirements set forth by the City of Chicago. A special focus should be placed on exceeding the energy code and green roofs.

1. Buildings should prioritize human health.

2. Design should respond to the seasonal wind patterns and opportunities for natural ventilation.

The City encourages goals of (i) 26 percent MBE and 6 percent WBE participation (measured against the total construction budget for the project or any
phase thereof), and (ii) 50 percent city resident hiring (measured against the total construction work hours for the project or any phase thereof). The M/WBE Participation Proposal must include a description of the applicant's proposed outreach plan designed to inform M/WBEs and city residents of job and contracting opportunities. Second, at the time of the applicant's submission for Part II permit review for the project or any phase thereof, the applicant must submit to DPD: (a) updates (if any) to the applicant's preliminary outreach plan; (b) a description of the applicant's outreach efforts and evidence of such outreach, including, without limitation, copies of certified letters to M/WBE contractor associations and the ward office of the alderman in which the project is located and receipts thereof; (c) responses to the applicant's outreach efforts; and (d) updates (if any) to the applicant's M/WBE and city resident participation goals. Third, prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for the project or any phase thereof, the applicant must provide DPD with the actual level of M/WBE and city resident participation in the project or any phase thereof, and evidence of such participation. In addition to the foregoing, DPD may request such additional information as the department determines may be necessary or useful in evaluating the extent to which M/WBEs and city residents are informed of and utilized in planned development projects. All such information will be provided in a form acceptable to the Zoning Administrator. DPD will report the data it collects regarding projected and actual employment of M/WBEs and city residents in planned development projects twice yearly to the Chicago Plan Commission and annually to the Chicago City Council and the Mayor.

16. The Applicant acknowledges and agrees that the rezoning of the Property from BPD Number 1292 to C2-5 and then to RBPD Number 1292, as amended, for construction of the Project triggers the requirements of Section 2-45-115 of the Municipal Code (the "Affordable Requirements Ordinance" or the "ARO"). The Applicant further acknowledges and agrees that the Property is located in the Near North/Near West Pilot Area, pursuant to Section 2-45-117 of the Municipal Code (the "Near North/Near West ARO Pilot Area Ordinance" or the "Pilot"). The Near North/Near West Pilot Area is divided into two zones: the Near North Zone and the Near West Zone; the Property is located in the Near North Zone. In the Near North Zone, pursuant to ARO, the percentage of units in a residential housing project required to be affordable for a period of 30 years, whether rental or for-sale, is increased from 10 percent to 20 percent. Any developer of a residential housing project in the Near North Zone must provide the first 10 percent of units required to be affordable (the "First Units") either: (i) in the residential housing project, or (ii) with the approval of the Commissioner of the Department of Housing (the "Commissioner"), in an off-site location within two miles of the Property and in the same or a different higher income area or downtown district, or (iii) any combination of (i) and (ii). In addition, the developer must provide the (second) 10 percent of units required to be affordable (the "Additional Units") either: (i) in the residential housing project, or (ii) with the Commissioner's approval, in an off-site location anywhere within the Near North/Near West Pilot Area, regardless of distance from the project or income area, or (iii) any combination of (i) and (ii). The project has a total of 453 market rate housing units. Applying the incentive for family-sized units pursuant to Section 2-45-117(G)(6) of the ARO, sixty-six (66) ARO units are required. The Applicant has agreed to satisfy its affordable housing obligation by providing sixty-seven (67) ARO units, of which thirty-four (34) are First Units and thirty-three (33) are Additional Units as set forth in the Affordable Housing Profile. The First Units will be constructed in the Subarea B
building as for-sale condominium units. The Additional Units shall be for-sale townhome units to be located within a development located at 2849 -- 2853 West Congress Parkway, 505 -- 515 South Francisco Avenue and 2830 -- 2856 and 2818 West Harrison Street (the "Off-Site Property"). If the Applicant subsequently reduces (or increases) the number of housing units in the project, or elects to build a for-sale project instead of a rental project, or (with the Commissioner's approval) elects to construct additional off-site units instead of on-site units, or at a different location than the Off-Site Property, the Applicant shall update and resubmit the Affordable Housing Profile Form to the Department of Planning and Development ("DPD") for review and approval. DPD may adjust the requirements to reflect any such change without amending the Planned Development. Prior to the issuance of any building permits for any residential building in the Planned Development, including, without limitation, excavation or foundation permits, the Applicant must execute and record an affordable housing agreement in accordance with Section 2-45-115(L). The terms of the affordable housing agreement and any amendments thereto are incorporated herein by this reference. The Applicant acknowledges and agrees that the affordable housing agreement will be recorded against the Planned Development, or the applicable portion thereof, as well as against the Off-Site Property, or the applicable portion thereof, and will constitute a lien against such properties. The Commissioner may enforce remedies for any breach of this Statement 16, including any breach of any affordable housing agreement, and enter into settlement agreements with respect to any such breach, subject to the approval of the Corporation Counsel, without amending the Planned Development.

17. The Applicant acknowledges that the Property is in close proximity to properties used for heavy industrial operations including but not limited to concrete, paving and construction material manufacturing (the "Neighboring Uses"). The Neighboring Uses are, in compliance with any City of Chicago code or regulation, permitted to operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with levels of noises and odors that are not static and may change. The Applicant agrees that it shall not object to the continuation of the Neighboring Uses and that the Neighboring Uses do not and shall not constitute a nuisance to the Property. Any tenant or potential buyer will be made aware of this condition at time of lease or purchase.

18. This Planned Development shall be governed by Section 17-13-0612. Should this Planned Development ordinance lapse, the Zoning Administrator shall initiate a zoning map amendment to rezone the Property to a Planned Development Number 1292, as amended on January 27, 2021.

Type 1 Zoning Map Amendment
Narrative, Analysis and Plans
750 West North Avenue
B3-5 District to B3-5 District (Type 1)

750 W North LLC is the "Applicant" for a Type 1 Zoning Map Amendment for the subject property located at 750 West North Avenue from the B3-5 Community Shopping District to the B3-5 Community Shopping District (Type 1) to allow the construction of a proposed 5-story mixed-use residential building with ground floor commercial and 48 residential units above.

The site is bounded by Concord Place to the north, CTA right-of-way on the east, West North Avenue on the south, and an existing Chicago Landmark building known as Yondorf Hall on the west. The subject property consists of approximately 10,810 square feet of site area and is improved with a surface parking lot with two existing curb cuts onto North Avenue and a single driveway onto Concord Place (a named public alley). The property is a transit-served location based on its proximity to the CTA Red Line station entrance at North/Clybourn.

The Applicant proposes to develop the property with a 5-story building containing approximately 2,277.7 square feet of commercial space on the ground floor and 48 residential units above. The overall project FAR will be 3.8. The proposed development will include 15 vehicular parking spaces and 48 bicycle parking spaces.

| Side (West):                    | 3 feet   |

| Building Height:                | 57 feet 6 inches |

* The Property is a transit-served location due to its proximity within 2,640 feet from the North/Clybourn CTA Red Line Station entrance and 1,320 feet from the Halsted CTA bus line corridor roadway segment. The proposed development will comply with the applicable Specific Criteria for Transit-Served Locations set forth in Section 17-3-0308.

** Pursuant to Section 17-13-0303-D of the Chicago Zoning Ordinance, as part of this Type 1 Zoning Map Amendment, the Applicant seeks (1) an administrative adjustment for a parking reduction in a transit-served location to reduce the required automobile parking from 48 spaces to 15 spaces; (2) a variation to reduce the minimum required rear setback for floors containing dwelling units from 30 feet to two feet; and (3) a variation to reduce the required off-street loading from one space to zero spaces.
HEREBY CERTIFY THAT THIS PLAN AND THE DISTANCE FROM THE SUBJECT PROPERTY TO THE NEAREST TRANSIT SERVED LOCATION (105'-11 WERE PREPARED UNDER DIRECT SUPERVISION AND TO THE BEST OF MY PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE.

Journal of the Proceedings of the City Council of the City of Chicago at pages 45918
through 45926, inclusive, and a Minor Change dated September 28, 2020. In any
instance where a provision of this Planned Development conflicts with the Chicago

to the intent and purpose of the Zoning Ordinance, and all requirements thereto, and
satisfies the established criteria for approval as a Planned Development. In case of a
conflict between the terms of this Planned Development ordinance and the Zoning
Ordinance, this Planned Development ordinance shall control.

5. The following uses are permitted within the area delineated as Residential-Business
Planned Development: dwelling units above the ground floor; animal services -- sales
and grooming, veterinary and kennels; eating and drinking establishments;
amusement arcades (accessory only to eating and drinking establishments); business
support services; building material sales; auto supply sales; banks, currency

Department of Planning and Development. Off-premises signs are prohibited within the boundary of the Planned Development.

7. For purposes of height measurement, the definitions in the Zoning Ordinance shall apply. The height of any building shall also be subject to height limitations, if any, established by the Federal Aviation Administration.

8. The maximum permitted floor area ratio ("FAR") for the site shall be in accordance with the attached Bulk Regulations Table. For the purposes of FAR calculations and measurements, the definitions in the Zoning Ordinance shall apply. The permitted FAR identified in the Bulk Regulations Table has been determined using a net site area of 23,315 square feet.

9. The Applicant acknowledges and agrees that the rezoning of the Property from B1-2 Neighborhood Shopping District and C1-2 Neighborhood Shopping District to B3-5 Community Shopping District, and then to this Planned Development, triggers the requirements of Section 2-45-115 of the Municipal Code of Chicago (the "ARO"). Any developer of a residential housing project within the meaning of the ARO must: (i) set aside 10 percent of the housing units in the residential housing project (the "Required Units") as affordable units, or with the Department's Commissioner's approval, provide the Required Units in an approved off-site location; (ii) pay a fee in lieu of the development of the Required Units; or (iii) any combination of (i) and (ii); provided, however, that residential housing projects with 20 or more units must provide at least 25 percent of the Required Units on-site or off-site. If the developer elects to provide affordable units off-site, the off-site affordable units must be located within a two-mile radius from the residential housing project and in the same or a different higher income area or downtown district. The Property is located in a higher income area, within the meaning of the ARO, and the project has a total of 120 units. As a result, the Applicant's affordable housing obligation is 12 affordable units, three of which are Required Units. Applicant has agreed to satisfy its affordable housing obligation by making a cash payment to the Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund in the amount of $125,000 per unit (at four units for a total of $500,000) (a "Cash Payment") and providing eight affordable units in the rental building to be constructed in the Planned Development. The Applicant agrees that the affordable rental/for sale units must be affordable to households earning no more than 60 percent of the Chicago Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area Median Income ("AMI"), as updated annually by the City of Chicago. If the Applicant subsequently reduces (or increases) the number of housing units in the Planned Development, the Applicant shall update and resubmit the Affordable Housing Profile Form to the Department for review and approval; the Department may adjust the number of required Affordable Units without amending the Planned Development. Prior to the issuance of any building permits for any residential building in the Planned Development, including, without limitation, excavation or foundation permits, the Applicant must make the required Cash Payment and/or execute and record an affordable housing agreement in accordance with Section 2-45-115(L) of the ARO. The terms of the affordable housing agreement and any amendments thereto are incorporated herein by this reference. The Applicant acknowledges and agrees that the affordable housing agreement will be recorded against the Planned Development, or the applicable portion thereof, and will constitute a lien against such property. The Commissioner of the Department may enforce remedies for any breach of this Statement Number 9, including any breach of any affordable housing agreement, and enter into settlement agreements with respect to
any such breach, subject to the approval of the Corporation Counsel, without amending the Planned Development.

10. Upon review and determination, "Part II review", pursuant to Section 17-13-0610 of the Zoning Ordinance, a Part II review fee shall be assessed by the Department of Planning and Development. The fee, as determined by staff at the time, is final and binding and must be paid to the Department of Revenue prior to the issuance of any Part II approval.

11. The Site Plans and Landscape Plans shall be in substantial conformance with the Landscape Ordinance and any other corresponding regulations and guidelines. Final landscape plan review and approval will be by the Department of Planning and Development. Any interim reviews associated with site plan review or Part II reviews, are conditional until final Part II approval.

12. The Applicant shall comply with Rules and Regulations for the Maintenance of Stockpiles promulgated by the Commissioners of the Departments of Streets and Sanitation, Environment and Buildings, under Section 13-32-125 of the Municipal Code, or any other provision of that code.

13. Subject to the provisions of Statement Number 2 of this Planned Development, the terms and conditions of development under this Planned Development ordinance may be modified administratively pursuant to Section 17-13-0611-A of the Zoning Ordinance by the Zoning Administrator upon the application for such a modification by the Applicant, its successors and assigns and, if different than the Applicant, the legal titleholders and any ground lessors.

14. The Applicant acknowledges that it is in the public interest to design, construct and maintain the project in a manner which promotes, enables and maximizes universal access throughout the Property as required by law. Plans for all new buildings and improvements on the Property constructed after the date hereof shall be reviewed and approved by the Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations related to access for persons with disabilities.

15. The Applicant acknowledges that it is in the public interest to design, construct, renovate and maintain all buildings in a manner that provides healthier indoor environments, reduces operating costs and conserves energy and natural resources. In furtherance of this policy, improvements within the Planned Development shall include at least the following sustainable features: (A) 50 percent Green Roof; and (B) Building Certification in accordance with City of Chicago's Sustainable Development Policy in effect as of the date of introduction of this planned development.

16. This Planned Development shall be governed by Section 17-13-0612 of the Zoning Ordinance. Should this Planned Development ordinance lapse due to the passage of time, the Commissioner of the Department shall initiate a zoning map amendment to rezone this Residential-Business Planned Development to B1-2 Neighborhood District.

14. The Applicant acknowledges that it is in the public interest to design, construct, renovate and maintain all buildings in a manner that provides healthier indoor environments, reduces operating costs and conserves energy and natural resources. The Applicant shall obtain the number of points necessary to meet the requirements of the Chicago Sustainable Development Policy, in effect at the time the Part II review process is initiated for each improvement that is subject to the aforementioned Policy and must provide documentation verifying compliance.

15. The Applicant acknowledges that it is the policy of the City to maximize opportunities for Minority- and Women-owned Business Enterprises ("M/WBEs") and city residents to compete for contracts and jobs on construction projects approved through the planned development process. To assist the City in promoting and tracking such M/WBE and city resident participation, an applicant for planned development approval shall provide information at three points in the city approval process. First, the applicant must submit to DPD, as part of its application for planned development approval, an M/WBE Participation Proposal. The M/WBE Participation Proposal must
identify the applicant's goals for participation of certified M/WBE firms in the design, engineering and construction of the project, and of city residents in the construction work. The City encourages goals of: (i) 26 percent MBE and 6 percent WBE participation (measured against the total construction budget for the project or any phase thereof); and (ii) 50 percent city resident hiring (measured against the total construction work hours for the project or any phase thereof). The M/WBE Participation Proposal must include a description of the applicant's proposed outreach plan designed to inform M/WBEs and city residents of job and contracting opportunities. Second, at the time of the applicant's submission for Part II permit review for the project or any phase thereof, the Applicant must submit to DPD: (a) updates (if any) to the applicant's preliminary outreach plan; (b) a description of the applicant's outreach efforts and evidence of such outreach, including, without limitation, copies of certified letters to M/WBE contractor associations and the ward office of the alderman in which the project is located and receipts thereof; (c) responses to the applicant's outreach efforts; and (d) updates (if any) to the applicant's M/WBE and city resident participation goals. Third, prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for the project or any phase thereof, the applicant must provide DPD with the actual level of M/WBE and city resident participation in the project or any phase thereof, and evidence of such participation. In addition to the foregoing, DPD may request such additional information as the department determines may be necessary or useful in evaluating the extent to which M/WBEs and city residents are informed of and utilized in planned development projects. All such information will be provided in a form acceptable to the Zoning Administrator. DPD will report the data it collects regarding projected and actual employment of M/WBEs and city residents in planned development projects twice yearly to the Chicago Plan Commission and annually to the Chicago City Council and the Mayor.

16. The Applicant acknowledges and agrees that the rezoning of the Property from the B3-3 Community Shopping District and C1-2 Neighborhood Commercial District to the B3-3 Community Shopping District, and then to this Planned Development ("P.D.") Number _____ is an "entitlement" that triggers the requirements of Section 2-44-085 of the Municipal Code of Chicago (the "ARO"). The Applicant intends to apply for Low-Income Housing Tax Credits or other forms of financial assistance from the City and other sources. Such financial assistance will impose affordability requirements (the "Financing Requirements") that exceed the ARO requirements. As a result, if the Applicant receives such financial assistance, the Financing Requirements shall govern the Applicant's obligation to provide affordable housing in the P.D. If the Applicant does not receive such financial assistance, the Applicant shall comply with the ARO.

17. This Planned Development shall be governed by Section 17-13-0612. Should this Planned Development ordinance lapse, the Zoning Administrator shall initiate a zoning map amendment to rezone the Property to the B3-3 Community Shopping District.

18. Prior to the Part II approval (Section 17-13-0610 of the Chicago Zoning Ordinance) in Subarea B, the Applicant shall submit a site plan, landscape plan and building elevations for the specific subarea for review and approval by the Department of Planning and Development (DPD). Review and approval by DPD is intended to assure
that specific development components substantially conform with the Planned Development (P.D.) and to assist the City in monitoring ongoing development. Subarea Site Plan Approval Submittals (Section 17-13-0800) need only include that portion of the Property for which approval is being sought by the Applicant. If the Applicant is seeking approval for a portion of the Property that represents less than an entire subarea, the Applicant shall also include a site plan for that area of the Property which is bounded on all sides by either public rights-of-way or the boundary of the nearest subarea. The site plan provided shall include all dimensioned and planned street rights-of-way. No Part II approval for any portion of the Property shall be granted until Site Plan approval has been granted. Following approval by DPD, the approved Subarea Site Plan Approval Submittals, supporting data and materials shall be made part of the main file and shall be deemed to be an integral part of the P.D. After approval of the Subarea Site Plan, changes or modifications may be made pursuant to the provisions of Statement 12. In the event of any inconsistency between approved plans and the terms of the P.D., the terms of the P.D. shall govern. Any Subarea Site Plan Approval Submittals shall, at a minimum, provide the following information:

- fully-dimensioned site plan (including a footprint of the proposed improvements);
- fully-dimensioned building elevations;
- fully-dimensioned landscape plan; and
- statistical information applicable to the subject subarea, including floor area, the applicable floor area ratio, uses to be established, building heights and setbacks.

Subarea Site Plan Approval Submittals shall include all other information necessary to illustrate substantial conformance to the P.D.

Nays -- None.

Alderperson Harris moved to reconsider the foregoing vote. The motion was lost.

The following is said ordinances as passed:

WHEREAS, Pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Municipal Code of Chicago (the "Municipal Code"), Sections 2-120-620 through 2-120-690, the Commission on Chicago Landmarks (the "Commission") has determined that the Kingdom Baptist Church Building located at 301 North Central Avenue, Chicago, Illinois, as more fully described in Exhibit A, attached hereto and incorporated herein, satisfies three criteria for landmark designation as set forth in Section 2-120-620 (1), (4) and (5) of the Municipal Code; and

WHEREAS, The Building, formerly The Fifteenth Church of Christ, Scientist, has served as a place of worship and remained a center for community in the Austin Community Area for nearly a century; and

WHEREAS, When Kingdom Baptist Church relocated to the Building in 1973, they opened it to greater Austin as a center of community, education and culture by establishing several key programs. Here, the congregation's mission, teaching and youth departments organized the Kingdom Day Care Center, Kingdom Chase House Day Care Center, Afterschool Program, Substance Abuse Ministry and hosted fashion shows, exercise classes, skating parties and youth parties; and

WHEREAS, The Building highlights the evolution of architectural styles over the 18-year construction period. It is an architecturally significant and unique example of the hybrid use of two distinct and divergent styles: Neoclassical and Art Deco. At the exterior, the Building's architect, Nelson Max Dunning, united the two styles through Neoclassical detailing, which was stylized and applied to the forms of the modern Art Deco style. The interior is also reflective of this integration, as the basement, first floor lobby and flanking staircases to the second floor auditorium are derivative of Classicism, while the interior of the auditorium is overall restrained and streamlined, with a focus on the decorative arts, representative of the Art Deco style; and
WHEREAS, The design for the Building limits the use of religious details and instead articulates Dunning's professional philosophy of functionalism expressed through design and use of minimal ornamentation; and

WHEREAS, The architecture of the Building reflects The Church of Christ, Scientist's evolving philosophies related to architecture as the visible proclamation of the church within cities. Historically, the denomination utilized Classical architecture which reflected the denomination's belief in progressivism.

TRIBUTE TO LATE MICHAEL HAMILTON.

WHEREAS, Michael Hamilton was born on March 31, 1955, under the vibrant spring skies of Germany. As a young boy, he embarked on a courageous journey across the ocean, ultimately finding his true home in 1958 when he was warmly embraced by Eliza and Ernest Taylor of Demopolis, Alabama. The Taylors gave Michael not just a loving home but also two brothers, Aaron (Bubba) and Ernest, with whom he forged an unbreakable
bond. He deeply cherished his adoptive parents for welcoming him into their family and nurturing his identity as a true American; and

WHEREAS, Michael's upbringing in Alabama was deeply rooted in the community of Morning Star Baptist Church, where he was baptized in June 1966. His high school days at Demopolis High School were marked by mischief and pride, especially as a member of the marching band -- a passion that endured throughout his life, highlighted by his joy when both his daughters chose to attend HBCUs known for their spirited band performances; and

WHEREAS, After graduating high school in 1973, Michael proudly served in the United States Army, joining the medical unit and demonstrating a steadfast commitment to service. Following his honorable discharge, he relocated to Chicago, diving into a new career in construction alongside his cousin, Leroy Dill. It was on Chicago's vibrant South Side that he met his soulmate, Justine Johnson, and her son, Jeffery, whom he lovingly embraced as his own. The family expanded with the addition of their daughters, Christa and April. Despite a brief relocation to California, the pull of Chicago's spirit and community brought them back permanently; and

WHEREAS, A dedicated union construction worker, Michael had a knack for fixing and creating, a skill he applied with passion both professionally and at home. His faith was a guiding light in his life, providing strength and direction through his knowledge of the Word and regular church attendance. His 42-year marriage to Justine was filled with love and companionship, reflecting their deep bond and mutual respect; and

WHEREAS, Michael's most pronounced trait was his profound love for family. He took immense pride in his daughters' accomplishments and cherished his role as a doting grandfather, giving each grandchild a unique nickname that reflected their special relationship. Known for his directness and honesty, his advice, though sometimes blunt, was always valued for its sincerity; and

WHEREAS, An avid Chicago sports fan, Michael cherished watching games, always with a cold beer in hand and a hopeful heart for another Bears Super Bowl victory. He relished local Chicago eats like Home of the Hoagy and Harold's Chicken, but nothing compared to Justine's home-cooked meals, which he declared unbeatable; and

WHEREAS, Michael was preceded in death by his parents, Eliza and Ernest Taylor, and two grandsons, Jeffrey and Jonathan. He leaves behind a loving legacy with his wife, Justine; daughters, April (married to Amadou) and Christa (married to Mark); son, Jeffery (married to Esha); grandchildren, Bricen, Rhyan, Aurielle, Jaylon, Justin, Kysen, Braque, Blaize, Aivy, and Noah; and brothers, Aaron and Ernest. His special cousins, Norma Jean and Beverly, along with a host of in-laws and friends, will continue to cherish his memory and the lasting impact of his remarkable life; now, therefore,

Be It Resolved, That we, the Mayor and members of the City Council of the City of Chicago, do hereby honor Michael Hamilton and celebrate his life, thank him for his service, and express our appreciation for his contributions to the community; and

Be It Further Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution be prepared and presented to the family of Michael Hamilton.
TRIBUTE TO LATE VIRGINIA HALAS MC CASKEY.

WHEREAS, The City of Chicago is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Virginia Halas McCaskey, the esteemed matriarch of the Chicago Bears, on February 5, 2025 at the age of 102; and

WHEREAS, Virginia Marion Halas McCaskey was born on January 5, 1923, in Chicago, as the eldest child of Minnie Bushing Halas and George Halas, the legendary founder of the Chicago Bears and one of the founding fathers of the National Football League (NFL); and

WHEREAS, By the time Virginia was born, her father George "Papa Bear" Halas was a household name in football as a player and coach for the Decatur Staleys, who had acquired the team for $100 from the A.E. Staley Company in 1921 and moved the team to Chicago with a new name the Chicago Bears, a nod to their stadium hosts the Chicago Cubs; and

WHEREAS, Virginia attended Chicago Public Schools until eighth grade, when she transferred to the parish school at St. Hilary in the Budlong Woods neighborhood before attending St. Scholastica Academy for high school; and

WHEREAS, In an attempt to gain skills to help her father manage the Bears, Virginia enrolled at Drexel Institute (now Drexel University) in Philadelphia at the age of 16 to study business management, where her uncle, Walter Halas, could keep a close eye on her as the school's football, baseball, and basketball coach and where she met her husband, Ed McCaskey, as a sophomore; and

WHEREAS, Ed and Virginia married in 1943 before Ed served in the 80th Division of the United States Army during World War II, and then returning to the Chicagoland area in 1949 where they raised eight boys and three girls, and were together for 60 years until his death in 2003 at 83 years old; and

WHEREAS, As a fiercely independent woman, Virginia was lovingly nicknamed 'Laughing Girl' by her husband Ed because of her amused reaction to anyone who asked how much hired help she received around the house with her large family, and her son Patrick remarked that "the only real time she had a break was when she went into the hospital to have another baby"; and

WHEREAS, From an early age, Virginia was immersed in the world of football, joining the Bears as a toddler on their barnstorming tour across the country with their star player Red Grange, attending nearly every Bears game for decades, and witnessing eight of the team's nine league championships, including their sole Super Bowl victory in 1986; and

WHEREAS, Upon the passing of her brother George "Mugs" Halas, Jr. in 1979 and her father in 1983, Virginia inherited the Bears franchise as the principal owner, becoming
one of the most influential women in professional sports, ensuring the franchise remained within the Halas-McCaskey family as a self-described "custodian" of her father's legacy; and

WHEREAS, A devout Catholic, Virginia lived her life guided by faith, family, and football -- in that order -- embodying a legacy of class, dignity, and perseverance in all her endeavors while living by the simple adage to always "do the right thing"; and

WHEREAS, Under her leadership, the Bears have grown from her father's modest investment to a world-class franchise valued at billions of dollars, with Virginia making difficult key decisions that shaped the franchise's trajectory, including appointing trusted executives outside of the family and empowering those executives to be fully independent on football matters; and

WHEREAS, Virginia's commitment to the Chicago community extended beyond the football field, exemplified by the establishment of the Bears Care Program that has issued grants of more than $31.5 Million to 225 qualifying agencies to support education, youth athletics, and medical research and health awareness programs focusing on breast and ovarian cancer; and

WHEREAS, Even while shunning the spotlight, Virginia was a role model for women in sports leadership, demonstrating unwavering commitment, humbleness, and passion for the game, and earning the respect of players, coaches, and fans alike; and

WHEREAS, Virginia was predeceased by her husband, Ed, her son, Timothy, who passed in 2011, and her son, Michael, who passed in 2020, while she is survived by her sons, Patrick (Gretchen), Edward, Jr. (Kathy), George (Barbara), Richard, Brian (Barbara), and Joseph; daughters, Ellen (Barney) Tonquest, Mary and Anne (Mike) Carton; 21 grandchildren; 40 great-grandchildren; and four great-great-grandchildren; and

WHEREAS, Virginia leaves behind a lasting legacy as one of the longest-tenured owners in professional sports, setting a remarkable example of philanthropy, leadership, humility, and devotion to the sport of football that will continue to inspire the Chicago Bears organization, the NFL, and the entire City of Chicago; now, therefore,

Be It Resolved, That we, the Mayor and members of the Chicago City Council, do hereby extend our deepest condolences to the family, friends, and all those who knew and admired Virginia "Mamma Bear" Halas McCaskey; and

Be It Further Resolved, That a suitable copy of this resolution be presented to the McCaskey family and the Chicago Bears organization as a symbol of our respect and gratitude for her extraordinary life and contributions to our city and the world of professional football.

WHEREAS, The City Council has been notified of this occasion by the Honorable Bill Conway, Alderperson of the 34th Ward; and

WHEREAS, Cardiovascular disease is rising as the world’s leading cause of death and disability; and

WHEREAS, More than 350,000 people experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital each year and only about 1 in 10 survive; more than 23,000 children under the age of 18 experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital each year in the United States, almost 40 percent of these being sports-related; and

WHEREAS, There are effective solutions to this problem: awareness and education to have cardiac emergency response plans in place, CPR education, and automated external defibrillator (AED) training and accessibility; and

WHEREAS, About 70 percent of cardiac arrests that occur outside of a hospital happen at home; and

WHEREAS, CPR, especially if performed immediately, can double or triple a person’s chance of survival; and only about 46 percent of people who experience cardiac arrest receive CPR from people nearby while waiting for emergency responders to arrive; and
WHEREAS, Knowing how to perform CPR properly has encouraged more people to act when faced with a cardiac emergency, and to save more lives from cardiac arrest outside of a hospital; we must increase the number of people who respond to cardiac arrest by calling 911, delivering high-quality CPR, and using an AED as soon as it is available; and

WHEREAS, CPR is a lifesaving skill that most people, including children as young as age 9, can learn; and

WHEREAS, The American Heart Association has set a goal of doubling the survival from cardiac arrest by 2030 by turning bystanders into lifesavers so that everyone, everywhere, is prepared and empowered to become a vital link in the chain of survival and provide CPR in response to a cardiac emergency; and

WHEREAS, In celebration of American Heart Month, we urge every household to join the Nation of Lifesavers™ and learn CPR; now, therefore,

Be It Resolved, We, the Mayor and the members of the City Council of the City of Chicago, gathered here this day of February 19, 2025, do hereby commemorate the month of February 2025 as “American Heart Month” in recognition of the importance of the ongoing fight against heart disease and stroke, and the effort to double the survival rate from cardiac arrest.

WHEREAS, During this battle, approximately 6,800 United States Marines lost their lives and more than 19,000 were wounded, becoming the only United States Marine battle during World War II where the American casualties exceeded those of the Japanese; and

WHEREAS, 22 United States Marines, including Chicagoans Joseph Jeremiah McCarthy and John Harold Leims, and five sailors were awarded the Medal of Honor, the highest military decoration awarded by the United States government, for their valor and service in the battle, reflecting the extraordinary sacrifice and heroism demonstrated by the men who fought on Iwo Jima; and

WHEREAS, Chicago-born James R. Michels was part of a 40-man combat party that was sent up Mount Suribachi to seize and occupy the crest. After the Marines accomplished this feat, Private First Class Michels stood guard in a defensive position as the first American flag was raised at 10:30 A.M., causing an uproar of cheers from Marines, sailors and Coast Guardsmen below; and

WHEREAS, In order for the American flag to be seen more easily from the ships, beaches, and land below, it was decided that a larger flag should be sent up Mount Suribachi to replace the first flag.

WHEREAS, The American flag raisings on Mount Suribachi, especially the second flag raising on February 23, 1945, became a defining moment in the history of the war and a symbol of American perseverance and courage; and

WHEREAS, The sacrifices made by these brave individuals and all those who fought in the Battle of Iwo Jima were essential to securing a victory in the Pacific theater of World War II and advancing the cause of freedom across the globe; and

WHEREAS, This year marks the 80th anniversary of the American flag raisings at Iwo Jima, offering an opportunity for the people of Chicago to reflect upon and honor the courageous service of our military men and women who fought, and in many cases gave their lives, during this decisive battle for our nation's liberty; and

WHEREAS, The City of Chicago recognizes the valor and sacrifices of the United States military personnel, both in battle and on the home front, who contributed to the victory over tyranny and the preservation of democratic values during World War II; now, therefore,

Be It Resolved, That the Chicago City Council hereby commemorates the 80th anniversary of the American flag raisings at Iwo Jima and expresses profound gratitude for the valor and sacrifice of all who served in the Battle of Iwo Jima and throughout World War II; and

Be It Further Resolved, That the City Council honors the memory of those who gave their lives in service to their country during the Battle of Iwo Jima, and acknowledges the indelible legacy they left behind for future generations of Americans; and
