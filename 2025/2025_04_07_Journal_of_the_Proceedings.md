[A2025-0016379]

The Committee on Committees and Rules submitted the following report:

CHICAGO, April 7, 2025.

To the President and Members of the City Council:

Your Committee on Committees and Rules, which met on April 7, 2025, considered the following appointment:

1. (A2025-0016379) Appointment of Anthony Quezada as the Alderman of the 35th Ward.

This item received approval by a roll call vote of the committee of 35 yeas and 10 nays.

Sincerely,

(Signed) MICHELLE A. HARRIS,
Chair.

On motion of Alderperson Harris, the committee's recommendation was Concurred In and the said proposed appointment of Anthony J. Quezada as Alderperson of the 35th Ward was Approved by yeas and nays as follows:

Yeas -- Alderpersons La Spata, Robinson, Hall, Mitchell, Harris, Chico, Lee, Ramirez, Quinn, Gutierrez, Curtis, O'Shea, Taylor, Rodriguez, Scott, Sigcho-Lopez, Fuentes, Burnett, Ervin, Cruz, Waguespack, Rodriguez-Sanchez, Conway, Mitts, Sposato, Nugent, Vasquez, Napolitano, Knudsen, Clay, Manaa-Hoppenworth, Hadden -- 32.

Nays -- Alderpersons Hopkins, Yancy, Beale, Lopez, Moore, Tabares, Cardona, Villegas, Reilly, Gardiner, Silverstein -- 11.

Alderperson Mitchell moved to reconsider the foregoing vote. The motion was lost.
At this point in the proceedings, the Honorable Thomas More Donnelly, Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County, administered the oath of office to the Honorable Anthony J. Quezada as newly appointed Alderperson of the 35th Ward. The oath of office of Alderperson Anthony J. Quezada was Placed on File in the Office of the City Clerk.

Speaking from the Clerk’s rostrum, Alderperson Quezada thanked Mayor Johnson, Chair Harris and the members of the City Council for the honor to serve as Alderperson of the 35th Ward. Expressing his appreciation to the 35th Ward community for their ongoing support and inspiration, Alderperson Quezada also recognized and thanked his family and friends, his colleagues at the Cook County Board and the residents of the Logan Square community. Alderperson Quezada also acknowledged and thanked former 35th Ward Alderperson and newly appointed General Superintendent and Chief Executive Officer of the Chicago Park District Carlos Ramirez-Rosa for his mentorship, support and friendship and for his leadership and commitment to justice and good governance. Proudly declaring himself a lifelong Chicagoan born and raised in Logan Square and the son of two working class immigrant parents, Alderperson Quezada spoke of how his father who immigrated from Mexico and his mother who immigrated from Costa Rica worked multiple jobs to support their family and the important lesson he learned from his parents and neighbors that “a community can thrive when people from diverse backgrounds care for each other, even under challenging economic circumstances and poverty”. While we celebrate the diversity of the 35th Ward community as well as the City of Chicago we must also remain cognizant of our common values and concerns, Alderperson Quezada stated and stressed the importance of elected leadership recognizing and advancing these core issues. Recalling his involvement first as a community organizer and later as a neighborhood services director in the 35th Ward office, Alderperson Quezada spoke of his responsibility in overseeing infrastructure improvement projects and assisting residents with accessing city and social services. Elected in 2020 as the 35th Ward democratic committeeperson and more recently elected in 2022 as commissioner of Cook County’s 8th District, Alderperson Quezada stated that in each of his roles he helped build coalitions, expand access to critical services, and fight for policies that prioritize working families. “Whether it was working to help build 100 affordable housing units at the Lucy Gonzalez apartments in Logan Square, helping families in deportation, standing along tenants for housing justice or delivering property tax transparency and relief at the county, I have always fought to bring people together to address our shared concerns”. Affirming his longstanding belief that “the guiding principle of government must be to do the greatest good and to improve the well-being of everyone, especially the most vulnerable in our communities”, Alderperson Quezada spoke of working alongside fellow Cook County Board members to increase funding to the Cook County health system and create dental health units across multiple clinics and as vice chair of the Labor Committee, collaborating to pass the paid leave ordinance, expanding benefits for workers in suburban Cook County and more recently, passing legislation to ensure intergovernmental collaboration between Cook County and the City of Chicago to address violence against the trans community. Reflecting on his service as a community organizer, neighborhood services director, Democratic committee person and county commissioner, Alderperson Quezada asserted that his actions have always been guided by lived experiences, both his own and his neighbors.
“From families being displaced by rising rents and a lack of affordable housing options to people sleeping under viaducts and trains to seniors forced to sell their homes due to increased property taxes, from students at our neighborhood schools who don’t have the resources they need to succeed and deserve, to the neighbors who can’t access mental healthcare or are forced to choose between medicine and groceries, these are the daily realities many Chicagoans are experiencing daily”. Pledging to fight every day to ensure that no one is left behind, Alderperson Quezada professed his commitment to the residents of the 35th Ward to continue his support of a community driven zoning and development process so that local zoning decisions are made with residents in mind to better meet local needs. Alderperson Quezada further vowed to work diligently to protect and build affordable housing, to pass reforms to the property tax system and help provide relief to struggling homeowners and to fight for improving and modernizing Chicago’s public transit system to not only drive economic development in our neighborhoods but also reduce the city’s carbon footprint and help combat climate change. Alderperson Quezada resolved to work on improving public safety by implementing data driven strategies and investments that create safer neighborhoods for everyone, with a particular focus on those who are discriminated against. Expressing his enthusiasm and pride in representing and serving the residents of the 35th Ward, Alderperson Quezada also declared his eagerness to work together with the Mayor and members of the City Council on the many challenges facing our city and the diverse needs of every community. Alderperson Quezada then called upon all Chicagoans to work shoulder to shoulder to help build a Chicago “where no one is left behind, where every person, no matter their income, zip code or where they were born, has a chance not just to survive but to thrive.”

Mayor Johnson then instructed the Sergeant-At-Arms to escort Alderperson Quezada to his City Council seat.
